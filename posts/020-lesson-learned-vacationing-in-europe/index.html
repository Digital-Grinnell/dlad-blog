It IS possible to work remotely from Europe, and even from a cruise at sea, but I found it difficult to be really productive.

SSH was supported, but only for periods of about 5 minutes at a time…not long enough to connect and get a lot done."><meta property="og:url" content="https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/020-lesson-learned-vacationing-in-europe/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="The Grinnell College Digital Library Application Developer's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Lessons Learned: Vacationing In Europe"><meta property="og:description" content="I just returned from 12-days of vacation and travel that took me unexpectedly to Paris and northern Finland, and as-expected to Norway (nearly all of it), and Iceland (expected, but not as promised).
