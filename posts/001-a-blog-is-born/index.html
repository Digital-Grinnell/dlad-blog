<p>Have you ever wondered how a blog is born? The story behind this blog begins with my interest in stepping back from the CMS world, primarily <a href=https://www.drupal.org/>Drupal</a>, to discover the joys of static site generation. The journey begins in earnest at the <a href=https://www.diglib.org/dlf-events/2016forum/>2016 DLF Forum: Milwaukee</a> on the eve of the United States' 2016 national election, when all the buzz that wasn&rsquo;t political, was about building static web sites, and <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the DLF Forum this server was born, thanks to the my colleagues in the <a href=https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/libraries>Grinnell College (GC) Libraries</a>, and Grinnell&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/its>Information Technology Services (ITS)</a> department. <em>JekyllDev</em> was its name, and Jelkyll development was its intended purpose. Life and work quickly got in the way of interests, as they are apt to do, and <em>JekyllDev</em> subsequently sat idle for nearly 2 years. During that span my work offered opportunities to learn about &lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; technologies like <a href=https://www.ansible.com/>Ansible</a>, <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/>Vagrant</a>, <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a>, and ultimately <a href=https://docksal.io/>Docksal</a>.</p>
<p>I was introduced to <em>Docksal</em> at a <em>Drupal</em> conference in the Fall of 2018, and immediately looked for ways to inform my local development work with it. About the same time there was renewed interest in creation of a static site associated with a project destined to appear in the <a href=https://www.eypae.com/client/grinnell-college/humanities-and-social-studies-complex>Humanities and Social Studies Complex</a>, the HSSC, at Grinnell College. I wondered if <em>Docksal</em> could help me, and others at GC, with development of a <em>Jekyll</em> site? It could, but along the way I discovered that <em>Docksal</em> already had a pre-built &lsquo;template&rsquo; for spinning up development sites in <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. So I started to play with that&mldr;<em>Hugo</em> sites created using <em>Docksal</em>. It&rsquo;s an absolutely awesome development workflow!</p>
<p>Using <em>Docksal</em> I was able to quickly spin up <em>local</em> copies of my work, including the blog you are reading now. But my workflow for pushing content to production was still lacking something. I wanted an efficient, Docker-based deployment strategy that would accommodate collaborative development and provide quick, automated builds. Fortunately, I stumbled upon the tremendous work of <a href=https://jtreminio.com/>Juan Treminio</a>, specifically his blog post titled <a href=https://jtreminio.com/blog/setting-up-a-static-site-with-hugo-and-push-to-deploy/>Setting Up a Static Site with Hugo and Push to Deploy</a>. It is exactly what I was looking for. ITS was kind enough to rename <em>JekyllDev</em> to something a bit more generic, namely <em>static</em>, and this server, <code>static.grinnell.edu</code> is the result.</p>
<p>My next post will attempt to chronicle the steps my associates and I took to complete the configuration of <code>static.grinnell.edu</code>, and ultimately to create this blog following <a href=https://jtreminio.com/>Juan Treminio&rsquo;s</a> lead.</p>
