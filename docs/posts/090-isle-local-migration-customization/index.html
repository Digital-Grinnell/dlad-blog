      <p>This post is an addendum to earlier <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/">post 087</a>. It is intended to chronicle my <em>customization</em> efforts, necessary steps that follow the aforementioned document&rsquo;s <code>Step 11</code>, to migrate to a <code>local development</code> instance of <em>Digital.Grinnell</em> on my work-issued iMac, <code>MA8660</code>, currently identified as <code>MAD25W812UJ1G9</code>.  Please refer to Steps 0 - 11 in <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/">post 087</a> for background info.</p>

<div class="original"><p>Note that it <strong>should NOT be necessary to repeat steps taken in this document</strong>.

</div>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is once again to spin up a local Islandora stack using <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/">the ISLE project</a> following the guidance of the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-migrate.md">install-local-migrate</a> document.  My process will be slightly different than documented since I&rsquo;ve already created a pair of private <a href="https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/">dg-isle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-islandora/">dg-islandora</a> repositories.</p>

<div class="annotation"><p>Note that there are no formal &ldquo;annotations&rdquo; in this document because everything here is an addendum/annotation to the original <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-migrate.md">install-local-migrate</a> document.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="outcomes-of-step-11">Outcomes of Step 11</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again#step-11-test-the-site">Step 11</a> I visited <a href="https://dg.localdomain">https://dg.localdomain</a> on my iMac desktop and found that the site came up looking and behaving just as it should, but with two warnings. The complete list of warnings was:</p>
<pre><code>    User warning: The following module is missing from the file system: antibot. For information about how to fix this, see the documentation page. in _drupal_trigger_error_with_delayed_logging() (line 1156 of /var/www/html/includes/bootstrap.inc).
    User warning: The following module is missing from the file system: islandora_mods_via_twig. For information about how to fix this, see the documentation page. in _drupal_trigger_error_with_delayed_logging() (line 1156 of /var/www/html/includes/bootstrap.inc).
</code></pre><h2 id="dealing-with-warnings">Dealing with Warnings</h2>
<p>Resolving these warnings would basically involve adding the missing modules to my <em>dg-islandora</em> repository. Remember, in our <code>docker-compose.local.yml</code> file we map the following:</p>
<pre><code>volumes:
  # Customization: Bind mounting Drupal Code instead of using default Docker volumes for local development with an IDE.
  - ../dg-islandora:/var/www/html:cached
</code></pre><p>So the task before me was to add these things to <em>dg-islandora</em>, and save the changes into the <em>dg-islandora</em> repo for use later on. Looking at my production instance of ISLE on <em>DGDocker1</em>, I found that the only missing &ldquo;contrib&rdquo; module was <code>antibot</code> which currently resides in <code>/opt/ISLE/persistent/html/sites/all/modules/contrib/antibot</code>.  The other missing module was part of the &ldquo;islandora&rdquo; branch of the module tree, residing in subdirectories of <code>/opt/ISLE/persistent/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_mods_via_twig</code>.</p>
<h3 id="antibot">antibot</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/antibot">antibot</a> module currently resides in <code>/opt/ISLE/persistent/html/sites/all/modules/contrib/antibot</code> on <em>DGDocker1</em>. I was curious what would happen if I opened a terminal into my local <em>Apache</em> container and used <code>drush pm-download...</code> to try installing this module. My command sequence on my desktop workstation was this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Workstation Commands</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>docker exec -w /var/www/html/sites/default isle-apache-ld drush pm-download antibot <br/> docker exec -w /var/www/html/sites/default isle-apache-ld drush cc all</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The results were very promising as the first command returned this:</p>
<pre><code>Project antibot (7.x-1.2) downloaded to                                [success]
/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib/antibot.
</code></pre><p>The 2nd <code>drush...</code> command subsequently returned only one warning  <strong>since the <code>antibot</code> warning was gone</strong>!  A peek inside my <code>dg-islandora</code> instance on the workstation was also promising. There I found this:</p>
<pre><code>╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-islandora/sites/all/modules/contrib ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master*›

...
</code></pre><p>So it appears that <code>antibot</code> was properly downloaded to the correct owner/group, and all that&rsquo;s missing is a proper set of its permissions, although I suspect it will function properly just as it is. A peek inside the new <code>antibot</code> directory showed this:</p>

</code></pre><p>I subsequently logged in to both my production and local instances of ISLE and visited the corresponding <code>antibot</code> configuration pages at <a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu/admin/config/system/antibot">https://digital.grinnell.edu/admin/config/system/antibot</a> and <a href="https://dg.localdomain/islandora/object/islandora%3Aroot#overlay=admin/config/system/antibot">https://dg.localdomain/islandora/object/islandora%3Aroot#overlay=admin/config/system/antibot</a>. The nearly identical pages indicate that my <code>antibot</code> configruation, presumably part of my imported production <em>Drupal</em> database, is intact and exactly as it should be.  This was good news indeed!</p>
<h3 id="islandora_mods_via_twig">islandora_mods_via_twig</h3>
<p>On <em>DGDocker1</em> I found a <code>.git</code> subdirectory in the <code>/opt/ISLE/persistent/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_mods_via_twig</code> directory indicating that this module should be provisioned using <code>git</code>. The module has a <code>git remote -v</code> response of <code>origin https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_via_twig.git</code> so I believe it would be prudent to add it as another git submodule. I did that like so:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Workstation Commands</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>cd ~/GitHub/dg-islandora</code> <br/> <code>git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_via_twig.git sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_mods_via_twig</code> <br/> <code>docker exec -w /var/www/html/sites/default isle-apache-ld drush cc all</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A quick visit to <a href="https://dg.localdomain">https://dg.localdomain</a> on my local workstation shows the site is working and with <strong>no visible errors or warnings</strong>!  Woot!</p>
<h3 id="two-probable-issues">Two Probable Issues</h3>
<p>So, it works&hellip;maybe. However, I am concerned with a couple of things so I decided to take a peek inside my new local ISLE instance to check. I did indeed find a couple of problems.</p>
<h4 id="permissions-and-ownership-of-antibot-and-islandora_mods_via_twig">Permissions and Ownership of &ldquo;antibot&rdquo; and &ldquo;islandora_mods_via_twig&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Inside the <em>Apache</em> container I checked the permissions of my <code>/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora</code> directory and found this, abridged for clarity:</p>
<pre><code>drwxr-x--- 10 islandora www-data  320 Sep  9 22:21 islandora_mods_display/
drwxr-xr-x  8 www-data  www-data  256 Sep 10 03:08 islandora_mods_via_twig/
drwxr-x--- 20 islandora www-data  640 Sep 10 02:10 islandora_multi_importer/
</code></pre><p>Likewise, inside <code>/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib</code> I found this, also abridged for clarity:</p>
<pre><code>drwxr-x--- 12 islandora www-data  384 Sep  9 22:20 announcements/
drwxr-xr-x 11 www-data  www-data  352 Jun 11  2018 antibot/
drwxr-x--- 12 islandora www-data  384 Sep  9 22:20 backup_migrate/
</code></pre><p>And inside both of those subdirectories I found structures with owner/group and permissions like this:</p>
<pre><code>root@5686019d1a3a:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_mods_via_twig# ll

</code></pre><p>Not good from an owner/group perspective, but looking OK in terms of permissions? So, the necessary changes I need to make here are ones that were previously performed as part of the <code>migration_site_vsets.sh</code> script back in <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again#step-10-run-islandora-drupal-site-scripts">Step 10: Run Islandora Drupal Site Scripts</a>. Specifically, inside the <em>Apache</em> container I need to rerun this command from that script:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>isle-apache-ld</em> Container Commands</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>/bin/bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/drupal/fix-permissions.sh --drupal_path=/var/www/html --drupal_user=islandora --httpd_group=www-data</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A quick check of the aforementioned directories and files inside the <em>Apache</em> container shows that owner/group and permissions are now as-they-should-be. Yay!</p>
<h4 id="where-have-all-the-files-gone">Where Have All the Files Gone?</h4>
<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m showing my age with that subtitle, I know. But it&rsquo;s a valid question, perhaps best summed up in this <em>Slack</em> post of mine:</p>

<div class="original"><p>At <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-migrate.md#drupal-site-files-and-code">https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-migrate.md#drupal-site-files-and-code</a> I made a copy of my production <code>/var/www/html/sites/default/files</code> directory anticipating that &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll move this directory in later steps.&rdquo;   I must have missed something, because I can&rsquo;t find anyplace in the document where I moved those files into my new local instance of ISLE.</p>
</div>

<p>The resolution of this issue is now covered in the annotation at the end of <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again#step-9-import-the-production-mysql-drupal-database">Step 9: Import the Production MySQL Drupal Database</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>After completion of everything mentioned in this document, I returned to <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again#step-12-ingest-sample-objects">Step 12: Ingest Sample Objects</a> but ended my work there differently than suggested. The differences are all covered in one final annotation there.</p>
<p>The <code>install-local-migrate.md</code> document subsequently suggests moving on to <a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/install/install-staging-migrate.md">Staging ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site</a> and I believe I will do just that, probably with production of another annotated document to chronicle my specific experience.</p>
<p>But before I go&hellip; I elected to take two more steps here. The first is&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating my <code>dg-islandora</code> repository with all of the changes made thus far.
<ul>
<li>Note that I did indeed update <code>dg-islandora</code>, but not the <code>master</code> branch. In my workstation&rsquo;s <code>~/GitHub/dg-islandora</code> directory I did this in order to save all changes made thus far into a new <code>completed-install-local-migrate</code> branch for safe-keeping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Code updates will be made to drupal core.
WARNING:  Updating core will discard any modifications made to Drupal core files, most noteworthy among these are .htaccess and robots.txt.  If you have made any modifications to these files, please back them up before updating so that you can re-create your modifications in the updated version of the file.
Note: Updating core can potentially break your site. It is NOT recommended to update production sites without prior testing.

</code></pre><p>In spite of the one error, this is looking much better. However, a quick visit to the <a href="https://dg.localdomain">local site</a> returns a page with LOTS of Javascript errors and so the image tiles that appear on our home page are no longer constrained to any reasonable size. 😦 Most errors are of the form:</p>
<pre><code>Blocked loading mixed active content &quot;http://dg.localdomain/sites/default/files/css/css_lQaZfjVpwP_oGNqdtWCSpJT1EMqXdMiU84ekLLxQnc4.css&quot;
</code></pre><p>This was not my first rodeo, so I immediately took a look at file permissions and ownership in the <em>Apache</em> container&rsquo;s <code>/var/www/html</code> directory, and it&rsquo;s a mess. Time to run the <code>fix-permissions.sh</code> script again&hellip;</p>

<p>And that helped a great deal, but didn&rsquo;t quite bring the site back exactly as it should have been.

<li>Install and configure <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR">LASIR</a> &ndash; this will also be delayed until after my migration instance is up-to-date and in production.</li>
<li>Configure and engage &ldquo;new&rdquo; ISLE features like &ldquo;Automated Testing&rdquo; &ndash; this will also be delayed until after my migration instance is up-to-date and in production.</li>
</ul>
<!--

## Cloning to Local
The first step is to clone my fork of _ISLE_, namely [dg-isle](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle.git), to my workstation at `~/GitHub/dg-isle`, checkout the `master` branch there, if necessary, and begin like so...

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/GitHub <br/> git clone https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle.git <br/> cd dg-isle |

# Local ISLE Installation: New Site

OK, I began by reading through the guidance provided in [Local ISLE Installation: New Site](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#local-isle-installation-new-site).  Having met all the requirements and satisfied all assumptions, I embarked on each installation step.  Each section below documents any special conditions I imposed as well as outcomes of each step.

## Step 1: Choose a Project Name

In [Step 1](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-1-choose-a-project-name) I chose a project name, as before, of `dg` to replace instances of `yourprojectnamehere`.

## Step 1.5: Edit "/etc/hosts" File

The outcome of [Step 1.5](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-15-edit-etchosts-file) left me with an `/etc/hosts` file that looks like this:

```
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##

## For Omeka-S v2
#127.0.0.1    localhost omeka.localdomain traefik.localdomain pma.localdomain solr.localdomain

## For ISLE ld
127.0.0.1  localhost dg.localdomain admin.dg.localdomain images.dg.localdomain portainer.dg.localdomain
```

Take note: In the above `/etc/hosts` file the last line that you see is also the last "uncommented" instance of `127.0.0.1 localhost...`.  This is critical!

## Step 2: Setup Git Project Repositories

Ok, I completed most of [Step 2](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-2-setup-git-project-repositories) long ago, so I've substituted a `git pull` command in place of `git clone`, and will now pick up with the sub-step that says `Run a git fetch`.  The results of the documented `git fetch icg-upstream` command are:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›

 * [new tag]         ISLE-1.4.2-release   -> ISLE-1.4.2-release
```

Next, the results of `git pull icg-upstream master`:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ git pull icg-upstream master

```

The one conflict in `install-local-migrate.md` were easy to resolve by accepting the new update from the `icg-upstream` remote.

Next, I commited the merge and pushed the result to my `dg-isle` master like so:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ git status

All is well, thus far.  Moving on.

## Step 3: Edit the ".env" File to Point to the Local Environment

I did as instructed in [Step 3](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-3-edit-the-env-file-to-point-to-the-local-environment), but since I had previously modified `sample.env` in my repo, the resulting `.env` file was this:

```
#### Activated ISLE environment
# To use an environment other than the default Demo, please change values below
# from the default Demo to one of the following: Local, Test, Staging or Production
# For more information, consult https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/install/install-environments/

COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=dg_local
BASE_DOMAIN=dg.localdomain
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=ld
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.local.yml:docker-compose.DG-FEDORA.yml
# :docker-compose.DATABASE.yml
```

Note the presence of a modified `COMPOSE_FILE` definition in my copy, with the addition of `docker-compose.DG-FEDORA.yml` used to pull in some convenient, local customization.

## Step 4: Create New Users and Passwords by Editing "local.env" File

This is another step that I completed long ago, and I don't believe there are any changes or additions here so, for now, I'm going to assume that all of my pertinent files are ready-to-go. The files involved in this step are: `local.env` and `config/apache/settings_php/settings.local.php`.

## Step 5: Create New Self-Signed Certs for Your Project

This is another step that I completed long ago, so all I did in this instance was look for the required files and changes to those files.  Here again, everything appears to be ready-to-go.

## Step 6: Download the ISLE Images

I ran `docker-compose pull` as instructed and after a couple of minutes I had this afirmative result:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ docker-compose pull
Pulling isle-portainer ... done
Pulling traefik        ... done
Pulling mysql          ... done
Pulling solr           ... done
Pulling fedora         ... done
Pulling apache         ... done
Pulling image-services ... done
```

## Step 7: Launch Process

Time to give it a go with `docker-compose up -d`, as documented.  My results:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ time docker-compose up -d
Recreating 7ac3d399c7b2_isle-portainer-ld ... done

Recreating isle-fedora-ld                 ... error

ERROR: for fedora  Cannot start service fedora: error while creating mount source path '/Volumes/DG-FEDORA/datastreamStore': mkdir /Volumes/DG-FEDORA: permission denied
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
docker-compose up -d  0.86s user 0.14s system 6% cpu 16.387 total
```

### Oops, I Forgot to Mount the DG-FEDORA Portable Repository

Been there, done that, again. Remember that custom `COMPOSE_FILE` line mentioned above in [Step 3](#step-3-edit-the-env-file-to-point-to-the-local-environment), well it requires that one of my `DG-FEDORA Portable Repo` USB memory sticks has to be mounted and accessible on the host. So I stuck stick `DG-FEDORA-0` into an available USB port and repeated the above command.  This time the result was:

```
╭─markmcfate@MAD25W812UJ1G9 ~/GitHub/dg-isle ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ time docker-compose up -d                                                                         1 ↵

Recreating isle-images-ld              ... done
docker-compose up -d  0.79s user 0.13s system 12% cpu 7.127 total
```

Much better!

## Step 8: Run Islandora Drupal Site Install Script

After running the prescribed command I used the `Command + shift + A` command in _iTerm2_ to select/highlight all of the output from the last command and I copied that into [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/271cbd668331f9c863a685da3d1ebe3f) rather than pasting it all here. It appears the install worked with perhaps one exception, there is an `rsync` error at line 207 in the aforementioned gist.  Lines 206-208 from the gist read:

```
Copying Islandora Installation...
rsync: rename "/var/www/html/sites/default/.settings.php.0lfAZl" -> "sites/default/settings.php": Device or resource busy (16)
rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1196) [sender=3.1.2]
```

I'm going to proceed to the next step and will try to determine if this issue was critical to the process, or if it can be ignored or easily overcome.

## Step 9: Test the Site

A web browser visit to [https://dg.localdomain/](https://dg.localdomain/) shows that the standard ISLE stack is working as a default-themed, pristine Islandora site with no front-page content and an empty FEDORA repository.  I was able to successfully login as `admin` with my super-secret password.

## Installing the DG Theme

[Step 10 in the documentation](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-10-ingest-sample-objects) calls for ingest of some sample objects, but this is where I depart from the script since I've done this a number of times before and already have a working FEDORA repository at-the-ready.

So my focus here turned to installing the [digital_grinnell_bootstrap](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital_grinnell_bootstrap) theme instead.  Initially I did this with a pair of `git clone...` commands, but later in this process I'm tasked with saving my _Islandora / Drupal_ code as-a-whole into a larger _Git_ repository that will include these themes.  Cloning a _Git_ repository inside another can lead to significant workflow problems, so lets use _Git_ `submodules` instead.

To do this we will need to engage Git to make changes inside our Apache container, so it's important to note that our Drupal webroot, namely `/var/www/html` inside the Apache container, maps to `~/GitHub/dg-isle/data/apache/html` on our workstation and in our `dg-isle` repository. From my workstation the commands to engage our theme as a submodule were:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/GitHub/dg-isle/data/apache/html/sites/all/themes <br/> git submodule add -b 7.x-3.x https://github.com/drupalprojects/bootstrap.git <br/> mkdir -p ~/GitHub/dg-isle/data/apache/html/sites/default/themes <br/> cd ~/GitHub/dg-isle/data/apache/html/sites/default/themes <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap.git |

Then inside the Apache container...

| Apache Container Commands |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/themes <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default/themes <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> drush -y pm-enable bootstrap digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap <br/> drush vset theme\_default digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap |


Success! The theme is in place and active on my [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/) site.  Just one more tweak here...

I visited [#overlay=admin/appearance/settings/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap](https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/appearance/settings/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap) and made sure ONLY the following boxes are checked:

  - Logo
  - Shortcut Icon
  - Use the default logo
  - Use the default shortcut icon

All other theme settings should be default values and need not be changed.

A visit to [the site](https://dg.localdomain/) with a refresh showed that this worked!







# Content Below This Point Has Been Commented Out

<!-- Progress Marker

## Connecting to FEDORA

The `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the `local-dg-fedora` branch of my [dg-isle](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle) project includes 3 lines that direct _FEDORA_ and _FGSearch_ to use the mounted and pre-configured `/Volumes/DG-FEDORA` USB stick for object storage. The commands and process required to use the USB stick are presented in [post 046, "DG-FEDORA: A Portable Object Repository"](https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/046-dg-fedora-a-portable-object-repository/).


## Restarting the Stack

Moving to [Step 7](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-7-launch-process) in the install [documentation](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/blob/master/docs/install/) produced [this gist](@TODO:add-missing-link-here).

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/GitHub/dg-isle <br/> time docker-compose up -d |

## Running the Drupal Installer Script

Moving on to [Step 8 according to the documentation](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-8-run-islandora-drupal-site-install-script)...

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/GitHub/dg-isle <br/> time docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle\_drupal\_build\_tools/isle\_islandora\_installer.sh |

It was at this point I discovered a new gem in `iTerm2`:  If you hit `Command + shift + A` the terminal will select/highlight all of the output from the last command.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  I've copied all that output and stuck it in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dbdc3a2f46dc5c3bbf7176e1384202d5) rather than pasting it all here.

## Testing the Site

Moving on to [Step 9 in the documentation](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-9-test-the-site)...

A web browser visit to [https://dg.localdomain/](https://dg.localdomain/) shows that the standard _ISLE_ stack is working~, and I was able to successfully login as `admin` with my super-secret password.

## Installing the DG Theme

[Step 10 in the documentation](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/blob/master/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-10-ingest-sample-objects) calls for ingest of some sample objects, but this is where I depart from the script since I've done this a number of times before.

So my focus here turned to installing the [digital_grinnell_bootstrap](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital_grinnell_bootstrap) theme instead.  Initially I did this with a pair of `git clone...` commands, but later in this process I'm tasked with saving my _Islandora / Drupal_ code as-a-whole into a larger _Git_ repository that will include these themes.  Cloning a _Git_ repository inside another can lead to significant workflow problems, so lets use _Git_ `submodules` instead.

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/themes <br/> git submodule add -b 7.x-3.x https://github.com/drupalprojects/bootstrap.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> mkdir -p /var/www/html/sites/default/themes <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default/themes <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush -y pm-enable bootstrap digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap <br/> drush vset theme\_default digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap |

Success! The theme is in place and active on my [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/) site.  Just one more tweak here...

I visited [#overlay=admin/appearance/settings/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap](https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/appearance/settings/digital\_grinnell\_bootstrap) and made sure ONLY the following boxes are checked:

  - Logo
  - Shortcut Icon
  - Use the default logo
  - Use the default shortcut icon

All other theme settings should be default values and need not be changed.

A visit to [the site](https://dg.localdomain/) with a refresh showed that this worked!

## Install the Islandora Multi-Importer (IMI)

It's important that we take this step BEFORE any that follow, otherwise the module will not install properly for reasons unknown.  Note that I'm installing a _Digital.Grinnell_-specific fork of the module here, and the process is this:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora\_multi\_importer.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd islandora\_multi\_importer <br/> composer install <br/> drush -y en islandora\_multi\_importer |

## Install the Missing *Backup and Migrate* Module

The *Backup and Migrate* module will be needed to quickly get our new _ISLE_ configured as we'd like.  Install it like so:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib <br/> drush dl backup\_migrate <br/> drush -y en backup\_migrate |

## Backup and Restore the Database Using *Backup and Migrate*

From the [https://digital.grinnell.edu](https://digital.grinnell.edu) production site...

  - Login as `System Admin`
  - From the `Development` menu (on the right) select `Clear Cache`
  - On the home page (https://digital.grinnell.edu), scroll to the bottom of the right-hand column.
  - Use the `Quick Backup` dialog, with all the defaults, to create and download a fresh backup.

Alternatively, you could...

  - Navigate to [https://digital.grinnell.edu/admin/config/system/backup_migrate/export/advanced](https://digital.grinnell.edu/admin/config/system/backup_migrate/export/advanced)
  - In the `Load Settings` box select `Default Settings w/ Users`
  - Click `Backup now` to backup the site
  - Click `Save` to save the file to your workstation `Downloads` folder

In the [https://dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain) site...

  - Visit [#overlay=admin/config/system/backup_migrate/restore](https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/config/system/backup_migrate/restore)
  - Click the `Restore` tab
  - Select the `Restore from an uploaded file` option
  - Click `Browse` in the `Upload a Backup File`
  - Navigate to your workstation `Downloads` folder and choose the backup file created moments ago
  - Click `Restore now`
  - Navigate your browser back to [https://dg.localdomain/](https://dg.localdomain/)
  - Take note of any warnings or errors that may be present.

## Restore Results...Lots of Warnings

OK, so when I did all of the above backup/restore process what I got back in the "Navigate your browser..." step was an unreadable host of warnings. Without panic I very calmly returned to my terminal and the shell open in the _Apache_ container and:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all |

This returned a number of warnings about missing modules and such.  No matter, that was to be expected and the full list of warnings is captured in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Digital-Grinnell/bc47f4528e702f1afeb58ceaab66b28c).

The remedy for most of these missing bits was to do the following while still in my open *Apache* terminal/shell:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush dl masquerade announcements email git\_deploy maillog r4032login smtp views\_bootstrap admin\_theme google\_analytics\_counter <br/> drush cc all |

Visiting the [site](https://dg.localdomain/) again shows that most of the *Drupal* missing modules are happy now, but there are still a number of *Islandora* bits missing, so I was left with the output as shown in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Digital-Grinnell/353fc06917db78d904a084b94d9b9982).

Next steps and sections, still working "off-script", will install all of these missing parts.

## Installing the Missing Islandora and Custom Modules

If I recall correctly, all of the missing _Islandora_ and custom modules listed above can be found in the *Apache* container on *DGDocker1*, our production instance of _ISLE_, at `/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora`.  So I started this process by opening a new shell in the aforementioned container on *DGDocker1* like so:

```

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> ls |

My recollection has been confirmed!  So the next step was to visit each missing module's folder to see what *git* `remote` each is tied to, like so:

```
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora# cd dg7; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7.git (push)
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/dg7# cd ../idu; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/idu.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/idu.git (push)

root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_binary_object# cd ../islandora_collection_search/; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_collection_search (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_collection_search (push)
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_collection_search# cd ../islandora_mods_display/; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_display.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_display.git (push)
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_mods_display# cd ../islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories/; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git (push)
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories# cd ../islandora_pdfjs_reader/; git remote -v
origin	git://github.com/nhart/islandora_pdfjs_reader.git (fetch)
origin	git://github.com/nhart/islandora_pdfjs_reader.git (push)
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_pdfjs_reader# cd ../islandora_solr_collection_view/; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solr_collection_view.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solr_collection_view.git (push)

```
| Apache Container Commands (on **PRODUCTION** _ISLE_ only!)* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> cd dg7; git remote -v <br/> cd ../idu; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_binary\_object/; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_collection\_search/; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_mods\_display/; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_solution\_pack\_oralhistories/; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_pdfjs\_reader/; git remote -v <br/> cd ../islandora\_solr\_collection_view/; git remote -v |

Note that I did NOT bother with the `islandora_multi_importer` (IMI) directory since I know for a fact that IMI requires installation via *Composer*. I also didn't bother looking for `transcript_ui` because it is a known sub-module of `islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories`.

It looks like all of the others can just be added as _Git_ submodules like so:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7.git <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/idu.git <br/> # git submodule add git://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora\_binary\_object.git <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora\_collection\_search <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora\_mods\_display.git <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora\_solution\_pack\_oralhistories.git <br/> # git submodule add git://github.com/nhart/islandora\_pdfjs\_reader.git <br/> git submodule add https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora\_solr\_collection_view.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all |

The `chown` command line above was required to bring ALL of the new modules' ownership into line with everything else in [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/).  Also note that two of the lines, for `islandora_binary_object` and `islandora_pdfjs_reader`, are commented out because of known issues with installation of those modules.

## Temporarily Eliminate Warnings

So my site, [https://dg.localdomain/](https://dg.localdomain/), is still issuing a few annoying warnings about missing pieces.  It's a safe bet that we don't need these modules, at least not right now, so just do this:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush -y dis islandora\_binary\_object islandora\_pdfjs\_reader <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora\_binary\_object' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora\_pdfjs\_reader' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora\_google\_scholar' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'phpexcel' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'ldap\_servers' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'ihc' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush cc all <br/> drush cc all |

You saw that correctly, I did `drush cc all` twice, just for good measure.  Now, just a couple more issues to deal with...

## Need a `private` File System

At this point the system is still issuing some warnings, and the most annoying is:

```
Warning: file_put_contents(private:///.htaccess): failed to open stream: &quot;DrupalPrivateStreamWrapper::stream_open&quot; call failed in file_put_contents() (line 496 of /var/www/html/includes/file.inc).
```

A visit in my browser to [https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/reports/status](https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/reports/status) helps to pinpoint the problem... we don't yet have a `private` file system.  Let's create one like so:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www <br/> mkdir private <br/> chown islandora:www-data private <br/> chmod 774 private <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all |

Now that same status report, [https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/reports/status](https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/reports/status), shows that we are still operating in `maintenance mode`, and some of our newest modules may require database updates.  To remedy those two conditions:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush updatedb -y <br/> drush vset maintenance\_mode 0 <br/> drush cc all |

## Solr Schema is NOT Right

Ok, at this point I believe that I have a good _Drupal_ database, a working _Fedora_ repository, and a solid _Islandora/Drupal_ codebase; but the _Solr_ schema associated with this configuration is **NOT** up-to-speed with _Digital.Grinnell's_ so the `dg7` code and the `dg7_collection` view are expecting _Solr_ fields that do not yet exist here.  What to do?

1. Save the current database using _Backup and Migrate_.
2. Save the current codebase to the host using `mkdir -p ../dg-islandora; docker cp isle-apache-ld:/var/www/html/. ../dg-islandora` and putting all of it into a new [Digital-Grinnell/dg-islandora](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-islandora) repository on _GitHub_ for safe-keeping.
3. Update the _FEDORA_ and _Solr_ schema and configuration using the guidance found in https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/ISLE-DG-Essentials/blob/master/README.md
4. Try pulling up the [site](https://dg.localdomain/) again.

# Huzzah! It works!

## Final Step...Capture the Working Code in `dg-islandora`

To wrap this up I followed [Step 11 in the install-local-new.md](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/blob/ISLE-1.3.0/docs/install/install-local-new.md#step-11-check-in-the-newly-created-islandora-drupal-site-code-into-is-git-repository) document to capture the state of my _Islandora/Drupal_ code.  In doing so I created my PRIVATE code repository, [dg-islandora](https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-islandora).
