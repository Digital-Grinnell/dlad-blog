      <description>These days I like to do all my terminal/command-line work in zsh, more specifically, with Oh My ZSH! and the bira theme. This previous post described the process I used on each of my Linux servers, and this post is similar, but written specifically for my Catalina (Macintosh OS X v10.15.x), workstations.
