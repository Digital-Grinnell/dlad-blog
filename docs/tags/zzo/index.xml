      <description>Once upon a time this blog had an address of https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM and it used a theme called M10c. Well, what was once is once again. If you read my New Blog Style and Features post you can learn a little more of this blog&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;interim&amp;rdquo; history.
By the way, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post at https://dlad.summittdweller.com, then you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. If you are looking at that old blog you probably see something more like this:

      <description>Welcome to my new blog theme/style with new features. All of the content, aka &amp;lsquo;posts&amp;rsquo;, from my old blog have been moved here, but there are still lots of remnants of the new theme, Zzo, lurking here. Please be patient with this new format while I work to fully implement all the features that this setup provides.
Also, thank you, Mackenzie. My daughter played an important role in helping me with this transition.
And it&amp;rsquo;s time to do some real work&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to share more here soon.</description>
