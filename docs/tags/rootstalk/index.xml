      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve nearly completed migration of all Grinnell College Libraries&#39; static sites to Azure and I&amp;rsquo;m updating this post to reflect that move. Wherever possible I&amp;rsquo;ll strike-through outdated information like this, and replace it with updated info.
 This post will instruct the reader to install necessary tools and engage the workflow I now use to develop and maintain a handful of Hugo static websites. The list of sites now includes both professional, those owned and operated by Grinnell College, as well as &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; sites that I develop, maintain and host myself.</description>
