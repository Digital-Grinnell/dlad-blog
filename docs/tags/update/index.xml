      <description>On Thursday, August 26, 2021, updates to a new iPad destined for the VAF (Visualizing Abolition and Freedom) installing in the Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s HSSC were completed. As of this writing the iPad has not been re-installed, but Facilities Management has been contacted to schedule that event soon.
New DigitalOcean Deployment Due to small differences between the aspect ratio and resolution of the old versus new devices, the kiosk site had to be re-designed. Changes were also necessary to help ensure that users of the kiosk could not &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; from the VAF screens and cause havoc by surfing the internet.</description>

      <description>Attention: This is an annotated copy of the ISLE project&amp;rsquo;s update.md document. Annotations specific to Digital.Grinnell appear in specially formatted blocks like this one
There was one universal change made here in the original text, specifically all references to master branches have been changed to main to correlate with updated names of the repositories involved in this process.
 Note: This update procedure was first performed &amp;ldquo;locally&amp;rdquo;, as recommended on 2021-June-22 when I attempted it on my Grinnell College MacBook Pro, MA10713, serial number C02FK0XXQ05Q.</description>
