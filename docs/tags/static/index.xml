      <title>Searching This Blog Using Fuse</title>

      <description>A short time ago I moved this blog from DigitalOcean to Azure, and along the way I discovered that my search feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t working properly. That old search mechanism used Fuse, which has NO dependencies, but that old scheme used a Hugo theme component that I found difficult to properly maintain. So, as this blog was moving to Azure I elected to try something a little different with Fuse and found this gist to help get it done.
As of this writing, the new search is limited to just finding tag references, and sometimes a search will return a 404 error because of a bad path reference.</description>

      <title>Moving Static Sites to Azure</title>

      <description>On Thursday, September 9, 2021, I discovered that Azure, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s offering of host/cloud services for Open Source developers, and a favored partner of Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s IT department, had come up with a Static Web App deployment scheme that allegedly would rival what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using at DigitalOcean. So, I first tried to migrate my very simple Static Landing Page Hugo static site to a new home on Azure. The process wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as slick and easy as at DigitalOcean, but Azure does nicely leverage GitHub Actions, and the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult to grasp.</description>

      <description>This morning, Tuesday, September 17, 2019, I awoke to find our https://static.grinnell.edu server, and all of the services on it, unreachable via the web. I managed to open a shell on the host and found that the server was up-and-running as expected, but a quick docker ps command indicated that one of the key services on the server, namely Traefik, had stopped and then failed to restart, repeatedly. Traefik is the service that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for routing web traffic on the static host.</description>
