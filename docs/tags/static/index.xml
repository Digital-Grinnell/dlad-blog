      <description>This morning, Tuesday, September 17, 2019, I awoke to find our https://static.grinnell.edu server, and all of the services on it, unreachable via the web. I managed to open a shell on the host and found that the server was up-and-running as expected, but a quick docker ps command indicated that one of the key services on the server, namely Traefik, had stopped and then failed to restart, repeatedly. Traefik is the service that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for routing web traffic on the static host.</description>
