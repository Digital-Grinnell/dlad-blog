      <description>For some time now Digital.Grinnell has been using ISLE in production, with an instance that was built from a &amp;ldquo;non-standard&amp;rdquo; workflow, one that was a little different than the Git workflow established in the ISLE install docs. Consequently, DG&amp;rsquo;s situation is a little different than what&amp;rsquo;s documented for ISLE, so my mission here is to describe and execute the steps I&amp;rsquo;m taking to get back into the documented workflow.
The steps will involve and achieve the following:
 Establish a working, local instance of my production DG site with an ISLE-1.</description>

      <description>This is a follow-up to previous posts 034, Building ISLE 1.2.0 (ld) and 037, Migrating Digital.Grinnell (DG) to ISLE 1.2.0 (ld) for Local Development where I successfully completed a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; build of ISLE v1.2.0 and subsequently started &amp;ldquo;customization&amp;rdquo; of that local instance. So, this post&amp;rsquo;s intent is to complete the goal stated in Migrating Digital.Grinnell (DG) to ISLE 1.2.0 (ld) for Local Development, but for ISLE 1.3.0, specifically to:
The goal of this project is to spin up a pristine, local Islandora stack using an updated fork of the ISLE project at https://github.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow-up to previous post 034 where I successfully completed a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; build of ISLE v1.2.0, but did no &amp;ldquo;customization&amp;rdquo; of that local instance. So, this post&amp;rsquo;s intent is to complete the goal stated in post 034, specifically to:
The goal of this project is to spin up a pristine, local Islandora stack using an updated fork of the ISLE project at https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg-isle, then introduce elements like the Digital Grinnell theme and custom modules like DG7. Once these pieces are in-place and working, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin adding other critical components as well as a robust set of data gleaned from https://digital.</description>
