      <description>Digital.Grinnell features a fair number of transcribed digital oral histories. Most are interviews conducted with Grinnelleans as they return to campus annualy for alumni Reunion or Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s Multicultural Reunion.
 What follows is largely sharable &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; content lifted from a &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; GitHub repository at https://github.com/McFateM/OHScribe, the README.md and WORKFLOW.md files in particular.
 OHScribe! https://ohscribe.grinnell.edu Note: This link was disabled in the spring of 2020, but is working again as of July 1, 2020, on host DGDocker3.
This is a Python 3 and Flask web application designed to transform oral history transcripts, presumably created using InqScribe, into XML suitable for ingest into the Islandora Oral Histories Solution Pack to populate a TRANSCRIPT datastream and its derivatives.</description>
