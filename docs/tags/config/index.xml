      <description>None of this is my creation, but it&amp;rsquo;s too valuable to forget! So kudos to Goran Nikolovski and his blog post.
The problem I ran into involved the Drupal update.php script, and an orphaned bit of configuration data. When I tried running update.php the first of 13 pending database updates kept throwing an exception telling me of a missing plugin, and that effectively killed the other 12 updates. ðŸ˜¦ Well, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t care that it was missing (and Drupal should not either) because the update was there to delete it, but since the update kept failing, we had ourselves an impossible loop.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working remotely from a desk on the 3rd floor of the MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) this morning and just ran into a problem with this blog&amp;hellip; some of my single and double quotes are rendered as &amp;ldquo;curly quotes&amp;rdquo; so I can&amp;rsquo;t effectively copy and paste them into a command line. While searching for a fix I found an awesome Hugo resource. It lists, among other things, ALL of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s standard configuration variables!
The settings I&amp;rsquo;m most interested in right now are part of BlackFriday, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s markdown rendering engine.</description>
