      <description>For the past couple of years I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in Digital.Grinnell to remove as much &amp;ldquo;customization&amp;rdquo; as I can. The effort is coming along, but still, there&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go. Every now and then I come across a feature that we just can&amp;rsquo;t live without, and it&amp;rsquo;s in times like those that I turn to PHPStorm for development and testing. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been operating without PHPStorm in ISLE because I worried that configuring the PHPStorm debugger in a Docker environment would be a time-consuming, tall task.</description>
