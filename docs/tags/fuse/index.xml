      <description>A short time ago I moved this blog from DigitalOcean to Azure, and along the way I discovered that my search feature wasn&amp;rsquo;t working properly. That old search mechanism used Fuse, which has NO dependencies, but that old scheme used a Hugo theme component that I found difficult to properly maintain. So, as this blog was moving to Azure I elected to try something a little different with Fuse and found this gist to help get it done.
As of this writing, the new search is limited to just finding tag references, and sometimes a search will return a 404 error because of a bad path reference.</description>
