      <description>These days I like to do all my terminal/command-line work in zsh, more specifically, with Oh My ZSH! and the bira theme. This previous post described the process I used on each of my Linux servers, and this post is similar, but written specifically for my Catalina (Macintosh OS X v10.15.x), workstations.
This is how I installed and configured zsh, and some other goodies, on my student Mac Mini workstation, MA6879&amp;hellip;
brew update brew install nano zsh chsh -s /bin/zsh mark exit # log back in after this echo $SHELL brew install wget git hugo docker # Docker and Hugo added just for good measure wget https://github.</description>

      <description>These days I like to do all my terminal/command-line work in zsh, more specifically, with Oh My ZSH! and the bira theme. So, on my new node dgdocker3, I added nano, zsh, and some other goodies by largely following How to Setup ZSH and Oh-my-zsh on Linux.
This is how I did it&amp;hellip;
sudo yum install nano sudo yum install zsh chsh -s /bin/zsh mcfatem exit # log back in after this echo $SHELL sudo yum install wget git wget https://github.</description>
