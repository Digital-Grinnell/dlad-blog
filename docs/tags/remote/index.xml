      <description>MA6879 is the tag ID of the Mac Mini student-workstation in my Grinnell College office in Burling Library. During the COVID-19 pandemic it&amp;rsquo;s the only Mac that I have access to on campus. But the Macs here in my home office are not allowed to run Screens 4, the software that I formerly used to make remote connections between Macs. Fortunately, since the IP address of MA6879 is &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; and known (by me!), I can use built-in tools to make my screen-share and remote-control connections.</description>
