title: New Theme and Search
---
I recently made changes to this blog that made the old theme "un-responsive", it no longer reformatted nicely for small, mobile devices.  So I've switched the theme to use [hugo-theme-m10c](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c), and I think it's a welcome improvement.

In addition, I found [this repo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-search-fuse-js) which provides an awesome wrapper in the form of a very elegant [Hugo theme component](https://gohugo.io/themes/theme-components/) around some work that I mentioned in an [earlier post](/blogs/McFateM/posts/011-search-me), namely [this awesome gist](https://gist.github.com/eddiewebb/735feb48f50f0ddd65ae5606a1cb41ae#layoutspagesearchhtml).  Consequently, the [mark.js](https://markjs.io/) keyword highlighting that was "broken" in my earlier search implementation is now working!

And that's a wrap. Until next time...
