This afternoon I finally got back to trying to implement some features of [LASIR](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR), the _Liberal Arts Sprint for Institutional Repositories_. The information I found initially was not what I expected to encounter, and that left me scratching my head just a bit. Fortunately, a colleague at the [ICG](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group) came through with the needed information and I immediately added it to my list of key resources.  You can find those resources in my _OneTab_ at:

And that's a... break.  I hope to add some details, and more links, when I return.
