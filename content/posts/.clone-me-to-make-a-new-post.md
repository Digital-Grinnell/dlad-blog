This text is for guidance only, be sure to replace it with the real thing!  Also, make sure you properly set the front matter (the stuff between the --- marks above).  

- Enter your own title.
- Properly set the date.  Note that in its current form my Atom configuration should automatically update the date and time.  If you don't want Atom messing with the date when you make subsequent changes, just strip off the time portion (everything following the 'T') and the date will be preserved.
- Remove the `draft` key or change its value to `false` when you are ready to publish the post.

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
