title: Updates to Atom and Themes
---

Recently I made several significant updates to this blog, including changes to my _Atom_ configuration, and the introduction of a new theme, plus a "theme component" to help manage _search_.  Both of these updates are perhaps best described in [this portion of the README.md file](https://github.com/McFateM/blogs-McFateM/blob/master/README.md#an-even-easier-update) in my blog's Github repo so I won't bother with the details here.

And that’s a wrap. Until next time…
