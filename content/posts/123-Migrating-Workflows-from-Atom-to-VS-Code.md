This might just be my shortest post ever in this blog, at least for now.  At this early date it's just a link to the [Atom No More?](https://blog.summittdweller.com/posts/2022/06/atom-no-more/) blog post in my personal blog.

As time passes I'll document here any work-specific changes I make to my new _VS Code_ environments. 

And that's a wrap.  Until next time, stay safe and wash your hands! :smile:
