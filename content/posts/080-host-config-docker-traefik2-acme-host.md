This post is celebrating the completion (really, is anything ever complete?) of a new server/host/stack deployment project: [docker-traefik2-acme-host](https://github.com/McFateM/docker-traefik2-acme-host). In order to make this post really easy to read, I'm going to wrap it up in one bullet...

  - [README.md](https://github.com/McFateM/docker-traefik2-acme-host/blob/master/README.md)

And that's a wrap. I am so pleased that this works (and it's not even Friday!)  :smile:
