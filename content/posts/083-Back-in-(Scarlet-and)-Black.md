Once upon a time this blog had an address of https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM and it used a theme called [M10c](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c). Well, what was once is once again. If you read my [New Blog Style and Features](/posts/067-new-blog-style-and-features/) post you can learn a little more of this blog's history.

By the way, if you're reading this post at https://dlad.summittdweller.com, then you're missing out. _If you are looking at that old blog you probably see something more like this:_

Please jump to https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM and catch up as quick as you can. I think you'll be happier in the end, I know I will.

## Why Move Back?

[Zzo](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-zzo/en) was (still is) a great theme, and over time you should see some elements of it creeping back into this blog.  But _Zzo_ switched (in December 2019) from using [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) for search to using [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/). _Fuse.js_ is also great, but it's also "fuzzy", and I found that what I really needed as more robust and flexible "exact" search capability.  You see, I knew there were several instances of phrases like `docker exec -it isle-apache-dg bash` in my blog posts from the past, but I didn't know which posts to look in, and _Fuse_ was no help. So I switched back to my "old" blog style, the one you're reading now, and found that good ol' reliable _M10c_ with _Lunr.js_ works nicely. It's not a flashy as _Zzo_ or _Fuse.js_, but **it works!**

## What's to Come?

Like I said above, over time you should see elements of _Zzo_ and my "interim" blog, https://dlad.summittdweller.com, creeping back into this blog.  As that happens I will do my best to document those changes here, or at least index new blog posts here to complete this tale.

And it's time to do some real work... I'll be back to share more here soon.  :smile:
