This post is intended to chronicle my efforts to build a new ISLE v1.3.0 `local development` instance of _Digital.Grinnell_ on my work-issued iMac, `MA8660`, and MacBook Air, `MA7053`.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to spin up a pristine, local Islandora stack using [the ISLE project](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/) at https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/, then introduce elements like the [Digital Grinnell theme](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital_grinnell_theme/) and custom modules like [DG7](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7/).  Once these pieces are in-place and working, I'll begin adding other critical components as well as a robust set of data gleaned from https://digital.grinnell.edu/.

## Using This Document
There are just a couple of notes regarding this document that I'd like to pass along to make it more useful.

  - **Gists** - You will find a few places in this post where I generated a [gist](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists) to take the place of lengthy command output.  Instead of a long stream of text you'll find a simple [link to a gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/98d09fdcc29f88ac88bf7b3cbfb8324d) like this.

  - **Workstation Commands** - There are lots of places in this document where I've captured a series of command lines along with output from those commands in block text.  Generally speaking, after each such block you will find a **Workstation Commands** table that can be used to conveniently copy and paste the necessary commands directly into your workstation. The tables look something like this:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE <br/> cd ISLE <br/> git checkout -b ld |

  - **Apache Container Commands** - Similar to `Workstation Commands`, a tabulated list of commands may appear with a heading of **Apache Container Commands**. \*Commands in such tables can be copied and pasted into your command line terminal, but ONLY after you have opened a shell into the _Apache_ container. The asterisk (\*) at the end of the table heading is there to remind you of this! See the [next section](#opening-a-shell-in-the-apache-container) of this document for additional details. These tables looks something like this:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib <br/> drush dl backup_migrate <br/> drush -y en backup_migrate |

## Opening a Shell in the Apache Container
This is something I find myself doing quite often during ISLE configuration, so here's a reminder of how I generally do this...
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects/ISLE ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹ld*›
╰─$ docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash
root@9bec4edd3964:/# cd /var/www/html
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html#
```
| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/ISLE <br/> docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash |

## A Bit of History
I've already got two forks of the [Islandora Collaboration Group's ISLE project](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) and cannot practically create another.  So, the first step in my process is to bring one of the [forks](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) in-sync with the upstream `master`.  I'm going to attempt doing this via my web browser using the guidance documented in [Syncing your fork to the original repository via the browser](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser).  Wish me luck.

## Syncing My Fork
Not much to tell you here.  I followed the guidance mentioned above and it worked nicely. Almost too painless to be true?  We shall see.  In any case, there's now an up-to-date fork of https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE in https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE.

## Cloning to Local
Next step, I believe is to clone the updated fork to `MA8660` (and/or `MA7053`), make a new `ld` branch there, and begin building.  The following command stream captures all of that...
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects ‹ruby-2.3.0›

## Moved This Post
Moments ago I moved this blog post into the new local copy of my fork.  I've also copied my previous work, from March 2019, to this fork.  That text is in `old-ISLE-ld.md` so I'm working on documents now in...
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects/ISLE ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹ld*›
╰─$ l *.md
-rw-r--r--  1 markmcfate  staff   3.3K Jul  3 16:13 021-rebuilding-isle-ld.md
-rw-r--r--  1 markmcfate  staff    71K Jul  3 16:19 old-ISLE-ld.md
```

## Installing per install-demo.md
This is first-and-foremost a `local development` copy of ISLE, so I'm following the process outlined in `install-demo.md` from the documentation collection at...
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects/ISLE/docs/install ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹ld*›

```

## Cleaning Up
I typically use the following command stream to clean up any Docker cruft before I begin anew.  Note: Uncomment the third line ONLY if you want to delete images and download new ones.  If you do, be patient, it could take several minutes depending on connection speed.

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| docker stop $(docker ps -q) <br/> docker rm -v $(docker ps -qa) <br/># docker image rm $(docker image ls -q) <br/> docker system prune --force |

## Launching the Stack
Moving to [Step 2](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE/blob/ld/docs/install/install-demo.md#step-2-launch-process) in the install [documentation](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE/blob/master/docs/install/install-demo.md) (with all the "pull" details removed) produced [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/1f45be46a5105f2fb2a9031034612722).

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/ISLE <br/> time docker-compose up -d |

## Running the Drupal Installer Script
Moving on to [Step 3 according to the documentation](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE/blob/ld/docs/install/install-demo.md#step-3-run-install-script) is...
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects/ISLE ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹ld*›
╰─$ time docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh
  ...several lines removed for clarity...
Done.
'all' cache was cleared.   [success]
docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash   0.04s user 0.03s system 0% cpu 7:52.12 total
```
| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/ISLE <br/> time docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash /utility-scripts/isle_drupal_build_tools/isle_islandora_installer.sh |

It was at this point I discovered a new gem in `iTerm2`:  If you hit `Command + shift + A` the terminal will select/highlight all of the output from the last command.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  I've copied all that output and stuck it in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/98d09fdcc29f88ac88bf7b3cbfb8324d) rather than pasting it all here.

## Testing the Site
Moving on to [Step 4 in the documentation](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE/blob/ld/docs/install/install-demo.md#step-4-test-the-site)...

A web browser visit to https://dg.localdomain/ shows that the standard ISLE stack is working~, and I was able to successfully login as `isle` with a password of `isle`~.

## Installing the DG Theme
[Step 5 in the documentation](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/ISLE/blob/ld/docs/install/install-demo.md#step-4-test-the-site) calls for ingest of some sample objects, but this is where I'm departing from the script since I've done this a number of times before.

So my focus here turned to installing the [digital_grinnell_bootstrap](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital_grinnell_bootstrap) theme instead.  The process was captured to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/516d4d8db0d7190bfed4e14874b358a8).

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/themes <br/> git clone https://github.com/drupalprojects/bootstrap.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd bootstrap <br/> git checkout 7.x-3.x <br/> drush -y en bootstrap <br/> mkdir -p /var/www/html/sites/default/themes <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default/themes <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/digital_grinnell_bootstrap.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd digital_grinnell_bootstrap <br/> drush -y pm-enable digital_grinnell_bootstrap <br/> drush vset theme_default digital_grinnell_bootstrap |

Success! The theme is in place and active on my [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/) site.  Just one more tweak here...

I visited https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/appearance/settings/digital_grinnell_bootstrap and made sure ONLY the following boxes are checked:

  - Logo
  - Shortcut Icon
  - Use the default logo
  - Use the default shortcut icon

All other theme settings should be default values and need not be changed.

A visit to [the site](https://dg.localdomain/) with a refresh showed that this worked!

Next, I attempted to dump my production Drupal database and restore it to [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/) as chronicled in the next sections.

## Install the Islandora Multi-Importer (IMI)
It's important that we take this step BEFORE any that follow, otherwise the module will not install properly. The result is captured in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/d8e7694032298e0518a88b3370872db8).

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> git clone https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data * <br/> cd islandora_multi_importer <br/> composer install <br/> drush -y en islandora_multi_importer <br/> |

## Install the Missing *Backup and Migrate* Module
The *Backup and Migrate* module will be needed to quickly get our new ISLE configured as we'd like.  Install it like so:
```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/Projects/ISLE ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹ld*›
╰─$ docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash
root@9bec4edd3964:/# cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib# drush dl backup_migrate
Project backup_migrate (7.x-3.6) downloaded to /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib/backup_migrate.                                         [success]
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib# drush -y en backup_migrate
The following extensions will be enabled: backup_migrate
Do you really want to continue? (y/n): y
backup_migrate was enabled successfully.   [ok]
backup_migrate defines the following permissions: access backup and migrate, perform backup, access backup files, delete backup files, restore from backup, administer backup and migrate
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib#
```
| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib <br/> drush dl backup_migrate <br/> drush -y en backup_migrate |

## Backup and Restore the Database Using *Backup and Migrate*

From the `https://digital.grinnell.edu` (production) site...

  - Login as `System Admin`
  - From the `Development` menu (on the right) select `Clear Cache`
  - On the home page (https://digital.grinnell.edu), scroll to the bottom of the right-hand column.
  - Use the `Quick Backup` dialog, with all the defaults, to create and download a fresh backup.

Alternatively, you could...

  - Navigate to https://digital.grinnell.edu/admin/config/system/backup_migrate/export/advanced
  - In the `Load Settings` box select `Default Settings w/ Users`
  - Click `Backup now` to backup the site
  - Click `Save` to save the file to your workstation `Downloads` folder

In the `dg.localdomain` site...

  - Visit https://dg.localdomain/#overlay=admin/config/system/backup_migrate/restore
  - Click the `Restore`
  - Select the `Restore from an uploaded file` option
  - Click `Browse` in the `Upload a Backup File`
  - Navigate to your workstation `Downloads` folder and choose the backup file created moments ago
  - Click `Restore now`
  - Navigate your browser back to `https://dg.localdomain/`
  - Take note of any warnings or errors that may be present.

## Restore Results...Lots of Warnings

OK, so when I did all of the above backup/restore process what I got back in the "Navigate your browser..." step was a dreaded WSOD, a white-screen-of-death. Without panic I very calmly (so I lied a little) returned to my terminal and the shell open in the *Apache* container and:

```
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/contrib# cd /var/www/html/sites/default
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/default# drush cc all
  ...numerous lines of output removed for clarity...
'all' cache was cleared.
```

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all |

This returned a number of warnings about missing modules and such.  No matter, that was to be expected.  So I returned to my browser and did a refresh... the site came back up, and presented a more-readable litany of warnings than did `drush cc all`.  The list of warnings is shown in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/bb3502c810e27fb1c5149790c39f4ccc).

The remedy for most of these missing bits was to do the following while still in my open *Apache* terminal/shell:

```
root@9bec4edd3964:/var/www/html/sites/default# drush dl masquerade announcements email git_deploy maillog r4032login smtp views_bootstrap field_group
  ...numerous lines of output removed for clarity...

| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush dl masquerade announcements email git_deploy maillog r4032login smtp views_bootstrap admin_theme google_analytics counter <br/> drush cc all |

Visiting the [site](https://dg.localdomain/) again shows that all of the *Drupal* missing modules are happy now, but there are still a number of *Islandora* bits missing. After removing any redundant messages I was left with:

```
   User warning: The following module is missing from the file system: dg7. For information about how to fix this, see the documentation page. in _drupal_trigger_error_with_delayed_logging() (line 1156 of /var/www/html/includes/bootstrap.inc).

   User warning: The following module is missing from the file system: islandora_solr_collection_view. For information about how to fix this, see the documentation page. in _drupal_trigger_error_with_delayed_logging() (line 1156 of /var/www/html/includes/bootstrap.inc).
   User warning: The following module is missing from the file system: transcripts_ui. For information about how to fix this, see the documentation page. in _drupal_trigger_error_with_delayed_logging() (line 1156 of /var/www/html/includes/bootstrap.inc).
```

Next steps and sections, still working "off-script", will install all of these missing parts.

## Installing the Missing Islandora/Custom Bits
If I recall correctly, all of the missing Islandora and custom modules listed above can be found in the *Apache* container on *DGDocker1*, our production instance of ISLE, at `/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora`.  So I started this process by opening a new shell in the aforementioned container on *DGDocker1* like so:
```

```
| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> ls |

My recollection has been confirmed!  So the next step was to visit each missing module's folder to see what *git* `remote` each is tied to, like so:

```
root@90ae0691e764:/var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora# cd dg7; git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7.git (fetch)

Note that I did NOT bother with the `islandora_multi_importer` (IMI) directory since I know for a fact that IMI requires installation via *Composer*. I also didn't bother looking for `transcript_ui` because it is a known sub-module of `islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories`.

It looks like all of the others can just be cloned using *git*, like so:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg7.git <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/idu.git <br/> # git clone git://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_binary_object.git <br/> git clone https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_collection_search <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_display.git <br/> git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solution_pack_oralhistories.git <br/> # git clone git://github.com/nhart/islandora_pdfjs_reader.git <br/> git clone https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_solr_collection_view.git <br/> chown -R islandora:www-data *<br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all <br/> |

The last command line above was required to bring ALL of the new modules' ownership into line with everything else in [dg.localdomain](https://dg.localdomain/).  Also note that two of the lines, for `islandora_binary_object` and `islandora_pdfjs_reader`, are commented out because of known issues with installation of those modules.

## Temporarily Eliminate Warnings
So the [site](https://dg.localdomain/) is still issuing a few annoying warnings about missing pieces.  In order to turn them off, for now, just do this:

| Apache Container Commands* |
| --- |
| cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush -y dis islandora_binary_object islandora_pdfjs_reader <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora_binary_object' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora_pdfjs_reader' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'islandora_google_scholar' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'phpexcel' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'ldap_servers' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush sqlq "DELETE FROM system WHERE name = 'ihc' AND type = 'module';" <br/> drush cc all |

# Building ISLE-DG-Essentials
The remaining critical step here involves packaging all of the customization of underlying services like FEDORA, FEDORAGSearch, and Solr, that exist for _Digital Grinnell_.  All of the necessary customization is already in play on _DGDocker1_, where ISLE is currently running in production. My approach to this step was to:

  1. Make a local clone of https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/RepositoryX.git as `~/Projects/ISLE-DG-Essentials`.
  2. Checkout the `ISLE-ld` branch of this new clone; that's the branch that holds all my work from early 2019.
  3. Remove _git_ from control of the new cloned repository.  This should leave just the latest `ISLE-ld` work in place.
  4. Make a new, empty, private _Github_ project at https://github.com/McFateM/ISLE-DG-Essentials.
  5. Push the local clone to the new _Github_ repo for long-term development and deployment.
  6. Update the `README.md` document in the new repo to reflect proper use of the project.

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects <br/> git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/RepositoryX.git ISLE-DG-Essentials <br/> cd ISLE-DG-ESSENTIALS <br/> git checkout ISLE-ld <br/> rm -fr .git <br/> git init <br/> git remote add origin https://github.com/McFateM/ISLE-DG-Essentials.git <br/> git add -A <br/> git commit -m "First commit (from old DigitalGrinnell/RepositoryX repo)" <br/> git push -u origin master |

| Important! |
| --- |
| See https://github.com/McFateM/ISLE-DG-Essentials/blob/master/README.md for much more detail. |

# Spinning up dg.localdomain
I put an updated copy of `docker-compose.override.yml` into the `ld` branch of my new [ISLE repo](https://github.com/McFateM/ISLE) so all that's needed now is to visit the local clone of that project, bring it down, and back up again like so:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/ISLE <br/> git checkout ld <br/> docker-compose stop <br/> docker-compose up -d |

It may take a few minutes for the site to come up.  Be patient and after a short break (5 minutes?) visit https://dg.localdomain to see the new site.

# Connecting to FEDORA
The aforementioned `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the `ld` branch of my https://github.com/McFateM/ISLE project includes 3 lines that direct _FEDORA_ and _FGSearch_ to use the mounted and pre-configured `/Volumes/DG-FEDORA` USB stick for object storage. The commands and process required to use the USB stick are presented here.

## Insert the DG-FEDORA USB Stick
To restore the *Fedora* repository from a previous build just insert the USB stick labeled `DG-FEDORA`.  On a Mac the USB stick should automatically mount as `/Volumes/DG-FEDORA`, and our `docker-compose.override.yml` file should connect this folder to our *Fedora* container to serve as our object repository.  However, by default the USB stick will be mounted `read-only`, and that won't work nicely.

## Re-Mount the `DG-FEDORA` Stick as Read-Write
To make the `DG-FEDORA` stick writable do this:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| sudo mount -u -w /Volumes/DG-FEDORA |

In this command `-u` modifies the status of the mounted filesystem, and `-w` mounts the filesystem as read-write.  The next steps will follow a documented process to re-index everything as needed.

Note that even with this change you will still get the following error when trying to update the _FEDORA_ `Resource Index` (RI):

```
Rebuilding...
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: This MulgaraConnector is read-only!
```

To get around this problem, permanently, I've modified the `docker-compose.override.yml` file to keep the `RI` off of the USB stick.  Not convenient, but apparently necessary.

## Re-Index DG-FEDORA and Solr
To re-index the *Fedora* repository on the aforementioned USB stick, follow the documented guidance at:
https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/migrate/reindex-process/.

### Shutdown FEDORA Using Method 2
You must stop the _FEDORA_ and _FGSearch_ services before proceeding with re-index operations.  Proceed as directed in [the document](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/migrate/reindex-process/), `Shutdown FEDORA Method 2` with username `admin` and a password of `isle_admin`.

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| docker exec -it isle-fedora-ld bash |

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| wget "http://admin:isle_admin:8080/manager/text/stop?path=/fedora" -O - -q |

### Reindex FEDORA RI (1 of 3)
Proceed as directed in [the document](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/migrate/reindex-process/), step 1 of 3.  Shell into the _FEDORA_ container and issue the _FEDORA_ commands documented here.

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| docker exec -it isle-fedora-ld bash |

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| cd /usr/local/fedora/server/bin <br/> /bin/sh fedora-rebuild.sh -r org.fcrepo.server.resourceIndex.ResourceIndexRebuilder > /usr/local/tomcat/logs/fedora_ri.log 2>&1 |

Note: Remove the `2>&1` suffix if you want to allow all warning and error messages to display immediately on-screen.

### Reindex SQL Database (2 of 3)
Proceed as directed in [the document](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/migrate/reindex-process/), step 2 of 3.  The _MySQL_ `root` password is: `ild_mysqlrt_2018`.

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| mysql -h mysql -u root -pild_mysqlrt_2018 |

| _MySQL_ Prompt Commands |
| --- |
| use fedora3; <br/> show tables; <br/> truncate table dcDates; <br/> truncate table doFields; <br/> truncate table doRegistry; <br/> truncate table fcrepoRebuildStatus; <br/> truncate table modelDeploymentMap; <br/> truncate table pidGen; <br/> exit |

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| cd /usr/local/fedora/server/bin <br/> /bin/sh fedora-rebuild.sh -r org.fcrepo.server.resourceIndex.ResourceIndexRebuilder > /usr/local/tomcat/logs/fedora_ri.log 2>&1 |

The last command block is indeed a repeat of step 1.  It rebuilds the index after a number of tables have been truncated in _FEDORA_'s _MySQL_ database.

### Reindex Solr (3 of 3)

| Important! |
| --- |
| Although it is NOT documented (as of July 10, 2019) you **must restart _FEDORA_ prior to running these commands! |

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| wget "http://admin:isle_admin:8080/manager/text/start?path=/fedora" -O - -q |

Now, proceed as directed in [the document](https://islandora-collaboration-group.github.io/ISLE/migrate/reindex-process/), step 3 of 3.  The `fgsAdmin` password is: `ild_fgs_admin_2018`

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| docker exec -it isle-fedora-ld bash |

| _FEDORA_ Container Commands |
| --- |
| cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fedoragsearch/client <br/> /bin/sh runRESTClient.sh localhost:8080 updateIndex fromFoxmlFiles |

## Check Your Status
At this point in the process I had a working local ISLE instance that looks and behaves almost exactly like _Digital.Grinnell_.  That's great!  But not perfect.  8^(  I also noted that there were NO oral history objects in my portable _FEDORA_ repository yet, and when I tried to add one I got a host of warnings.  So, I decided to pay a visit to https://dg.localdomain/admin/reports/status, the _Drupal_ site status report.  That report did flag a host of issues, mostly related to my `private file system`.  The full report is captured in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/McFateM/c5ea76f38c06971df32dcdaf90d61b45).

To correct the most pressing problem, the lack of a `private file system`, try this:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/ISLE <br/> docker exec -it isle-apache-ld bash |

| Apache Container Commands |
| --- |
| cd /var/www <br/> mkdir private <br/> chown islandora:www-data private <br/> chmod 774 private <br/> cd /var/www/html/sites/default <br/> drush cc all |

Now revisit http://dg.localdomain/admin/reports/status and refresh your browser to see if this has fixed one or more issues.  In my case, multiple issues were resolved by taking this action.  However, one critical issue remained:
```
Error - Database updates -	Out of date
Some modules have database schema updates to install. You should run the database update script immediately.
```

I opened the [database update script](https://dg.localdomain/update.php?op=info) in my browser and used it to run all pending updates, 7 of them.  I then returned to the site's [home page](http://dg.localdomain/) and used the `Clear Cache` link in the right-hand margin (under the `Development` menu heading) to refresh the cache.  Then I re-visited the [status report](http://dg.localdomain/admin/reports/status) for one more check.  Only the inconsequential `Glip Library` and `HTTP request status` warnings remain.

## Ingest an Oral History with Transcription
My `DG-FEDORA` USB stick is still read/write mounted at `/Volumes/DG-FEDORA` so I put a copy of one transcribed oral history interview package (an entire directory of files) titled `Lynne_Simcox_64` on the stick.  Ingest of this content went something like this:

  - Open https://dg.localdomain/islandora/object/grinnell:alumni-oral-histories/manage
  - Click the `Add an object to this Collection` link
  - I entered minimal metadata (only the `Title` is required) and clicked `Next`
  - At the `Video or Audio` prompt I browsed and selected the `Lynne_Simcox_64.MP3` file in `/Volumes/DG-FEDORA/Lynne_Simcox_64`, then clicked `Upload`
  - Under the `Trasncript file` prompt I browsed and selected `Lynne_Simcox_64_transcript.xml` from the same directory and clicked `Upload`
  - Finally, I clicked `Ingest` and waited for a couple of minutes for the magic to happen

What I got in the end were these messages:

```
    Derivatives successfully created.
    "Lynne Simcox '64" (ID: grinnell:25497) has been ingested.
```

...plus an ominous message stating: ` This transcript is still being processed for display.`  That's the "error" I am trying to debug/eliminate now, but since that debugging is not part of a "normal" spin-up of _ISLE_, I'm going to document it in a future blog post (starting minutes from now).

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
