I've created a new fork of [dodeeric/omeka-s-docker](https://github.com/dodeeric/omeka-s-docker) at [DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker), and it introduces a new `docker-compose.yml` file for spinning [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/s/) up locally, but WITHOUT Docksal (due to problems with the integration originally documented [here](https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/019-dockerized-omeka-s/)).

System requirements for local development of this project currently include:

- [Docker (Community Edition)](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Local Development and Testing

If your workstation is able to run the aforementioned required components then the following steps can be used to launch and develop a local instance.  Assuming your workstation is Linux or a Mac, you'll need to edit your `/etc/hosts` with an editor of your choice, and `sudo` privileges might be required.  For me this was...

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

In the `/etc/hosts` file comment out any line beginning with `127.0.0.1` and add the following two lines just above it...
```
### For omeka-s-docker
127.0.0.1    localhost omeka.localdomain pma.localdomain gramps.localdomain
```
The new `127.0.0.1...` line will enable you to use `http://omeka.localdomain` to open and work with your new Omeka-S instance in any browser on your workstation.

Now to launch Omeka-S, return to your workstation terminal and...

```
cd ~/Projects    # or any path of your choice
git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker.git
cd omeka-s-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose up -d` command in this sequence should launch the project locally.  Once it is complete you should be able to open any browser and visit `http://omeka.localdomain` to work with Omeka-S, or `http://pma.localdomain` if you want PHPMyAdmin.

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
