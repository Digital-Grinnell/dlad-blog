The task _du jour_ is to being, and perhaps complete, the process of adding a custom 404 page to _Rootstalk_.  

Thus far I've found a couple of promising resources to guide the effort:  

  - [Custom 404 Page](https://gohugo.io/templates/404/)
  - [Custom 404 pages in Hugo done right](https://moonbooth.com/hugo/custom-404/)

In particular, I'm focusing on "Option 2" in the "...done right" document, and the "Azure Static Web App" portion of the first document.

I'm sure there will soon be much more here, but for this installment... That's a wrap!
