This post was written as follow-up to my previous post where I implemented a custom Hugo shortcode, `attachments.html`, documented in [attachments.html](#attachmentshtml) below.  The implementation of this shortcode required a Hugo [Page Bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) content structure and the transition to such a structure is documented below in [Page Bundles Structure](#page-bundles-structure).  

## attachments.html

## Page Bundles Structure

Transitioning this blog to a _page bundles_ organizational strucuture involved running the [https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/bash-script-to-convert-hugo-content-files-to-page-bundles/9776](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/bash-script-to-convert-hugo-content-files-to-page-bundles/9776) script which I named `page-bundles.sh`.

I'm sure there will be more here soon, but for now... that's a wrap.
