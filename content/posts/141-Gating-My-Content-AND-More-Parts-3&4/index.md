# Introducing Wieting Content

Part 3 of this process, the introduction of Wieting Theatre Guild content, is described in the project repo's `README.md` file.  Since the project is in a _private_ repo I'll include the pertinent parts here from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/SummittDweller/eb67aa53b3ec3c1d78e1d47d04399ee5).
