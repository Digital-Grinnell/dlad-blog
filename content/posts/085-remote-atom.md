Earlier this year I installed and configured the [remote-atom](https://atom.io/packages/remote-atom) package to assist with editing content and code for my [personal blog](https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark). Naturally, I wrote a [blog post](https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/adding-remote-atom-to-my-digitalocean-server/) to document it.

In the past week I've added the **remote-atom** package, and configuration to many of my [Digital.Grinnell](https://digital.grinnell.edu) servers. The installation and configuration was virtually identical to what I described in [Adding remote-atom to my DigitalOcean Server](https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/adding-remote-atom-to-my-digitalocean-server/).  Thus far the package and it's configuration have been implemented on the following workstations, both personal and professional:

| Workstations |
| --- |
| Mark's Mac Mini - Personal |
| MA8660 - iMac |
| MA7053 - MacBook |

And as the following username@server remote platforms:

| Username and Remote Server |
| --- |
| islandora@dgdocker1.grinnell.edu |
| islandora@dgdockerx.grinnell.edu |
| administrator@static.grinnell.edu |

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
