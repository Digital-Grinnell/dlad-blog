I'm working remotely from a desk on the 3rd floor of the MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) this morning and just ran into a problem with this blog... some of my single and double quotes are rendered as "curly quotes" so I can't effectively copy and paste them into a command line.  While searching for a fix I found this awesome Hugo resource: https://gohugobrasil.netlify.com/getting-started/configuration.  It lists, among other things, ALL of Hugo's standard configuration variables!

The setting I'm most interested in right now:  
```
[blackfriday]
  smartypants = false
```  

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
