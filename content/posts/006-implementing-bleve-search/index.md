title: Bleve Search - Note to Self
---

Had a conversation about lots of topics this afternoon and bumped into [bleve](https://blevesearch.com/), along the way, including a discussion about [adding search capability to a Hugo site](https://blevesearch.com/news/Site-Search/).  _bleeeve_ is based on the [Go programming language](https://golang.org), as is Hugo, so I hope implementation is super simple.  

I think in the near future I'll have a look at adding such a feature to this blog, and perhaps to the [Visualizing Abolition and Freedom](https://vaf.grinnell.edu) site too!

In conversation we also bumped into [Lunr JS](https://lunrjs.com) and I might consider attempting to implement it instead.  But _Lunr_ is all Javascript and I'd rather steer clear of that if at all possible.

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
