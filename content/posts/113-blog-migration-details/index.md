# The Grinnell College Digital Library Application Developer's Blog

{{% annotation %}}
I'm getting really lazy in my old age, so what I've posted here is just the meager `README.md` file from my blog's new _GitHub_ repo.
{{% /annotation %}}


This project, my Grinnell College [Digital Library Application Developer's blog](/), is no longer a [Docker "Multi-Stage" build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

## GitHub Pages

I successfully moved this blog to _GitHub Pages_ in October 2021, after creating instances of it on _DigitalOcean_ and _Azure_.  _GH Pages_, specifically https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/ seems like the right home for it, finally.

## Resources

I've create a _OneTab_ of resources that I used here: https://www.one-tab.com/page/Pm1eXBmxS8KOe7PjCt_DLg.  Enjoy!
And that's a wrap. Until next time...
