The documentation is sparse (surprise, surprise), but you should be able to figure it out by example. https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/js is such documentation as there is. If you take a look at our existing `custom.js`, _now part of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/primo-explore-package-CUSTOM_ and see how I've inserted the blurb about contacting me or Tony if you have problems with a link? You want to do that; you just need to find the right prm- directive to attach it to.
