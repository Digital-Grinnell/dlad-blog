I have ITS tickets, for seemingly simple DNS changes, that are now more than a month old, and because of that I've taken steps to try and do some _ISLE_ staging work on one of my _DigitalOcean_ droplets, namely _summitt-services-droplet-01_. In order to accommodate that I've moved nearly all of the sites and services from that droplet to my other, _summitt-dweller-DO-docker_.  The site migration was a smooth process except for [https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com](https://wieting.tamatoledo.com). That _Drupal 8_ site has been difficult to upgrade and migrate largely because it was deployed using my old _Port-Ability_ scripts, and about a year ago I scrapped _Port-Ability_ in favor of [Docksal](https://docksal.io), but I never got around to moving that particular site to a _Docksal_ environment.  Well, now I'm finding it almost impossible to complete that migration to _Docksal_.

# The Problem with Docksal

_Docksal_ is a wonderful development environment, but I can't find an effective, and easily repeatable, path from development to production when using it. _Docksal_ provides system services including an `SSH Agent`, `DNS`, and `Reverse Proxy` as documented [here](https://docs.docksal.io/core/overview/).  _Docksal_ services are provided by a `cli` container/service which is also responsible for providing a robust set of `fin` commands.  In addition to `cli`, a typical _Docksal_ stack also provides containers for `web` and `db`, and those look a lot like what I like to deploy for _Drupal_ in production.  However, the `cli` container looks nothing like what I deploy in production, and therein lies the rub.

# The Promise of Lando

Hindsight is 20/20, so this must be the year to look back and make course corrections, right?  Had I not fallen so quickly for the speed and glitz of _Docksal_ I would have given some of its alternatives, like [Lando](https://lando.dev), a closer look.  The immediate promise of _Lando_ is that it builds, in development, a stack that looks much more like what I wish to deploy in production, and it does so by not integrating as tightly as _Docksal_ does.

# Migrating the Wieting Theatre Web Site to Lando

Another thing that I like about _Lando_ is the fact that [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com) has taken it for a spin and documented some of his experience with it in his blog. So I have elected to begin my adventures in _Lando_ with [this post](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/getting-started-lando-testing-fresh-drupal-8-umami-site).

After following Jeff's lead I discovered that it left me a little short of my goal... to spin up an **existing** _Drupal 8_ site using _Lando_.  So, I backed off a bit and returned to studying the contents of [https://github.com/lando/lando](https://github.com/lando/lando).  Along the way I found a post by the folks at [colorfield](https://colorfield.be/).

## Following colorfield.be

Go to the directory where your app was initialized and run `lando start` to get rolling.
Check the LOCATION printed below if you are unsure where to go.

Oh... and here are some vitals:

A visit to [https://wieting.lndo.site](https://wieting.lndo.site) takes me to the `/core/install.php` script where I set the following...

  - Database username: drupal8
  - Database password: drupal8
  - Host: database

BOOMSHAKALAKA! The site info was already there.  The [site](https://wieting.lndo.site) is up!

## Committing to GitHub

Since there are no secrets in this config, yet, I'm going to push it to _GitHub_.  Specifically... [SummittDweller/wieting-lando](https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-lando).

## Restarting Local Development

I'm back at work on the campus of _Grinnell College_ today and am looking to pick up last evening's development here, so I need to "move" my project to a different host, namely _MA8660_.  Let's see if this works...

```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub ‹ruby-2.3.0›
╰─$ git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-lando
Cloning into 'wieting-lando'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 30, done.

╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub ‹ruby-2.3.0›
╰─$ cd wieting-lando           
```

Whoa! The `wieting-lando` directory looks a little empty, probably because I see that my `.gitignore` file ignored alot of stuff. :frowning:  No matter, let's see if we can work some magic...

```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub/wieting-lando ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ lando composer update
  ...and the magic happens...
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub/wieting-lando ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master›
╰─$ lando start
Let's get this party started! Starting app..
  ...more magic...
Waiting until database service is ready...

BOOMSHAKALAKA!!!

Your app has started up correctly.
Here are some vitals:

 NAME                  wieting
 LOCATION              /Users/markmcfate/GitHub/wieting-lando
 SERVICES              appserver_nginx, appserver, database
 APPSERVER_NGINX URLS  https://localhost:32773
                       http://localhost:32774
                       http://wieting.lndo.site:8000
                       https://wieting.lndo.site:444
```

And BOOM, we are ready to install a new site again!

## Switching Gears...Again

I'm turning my attention now to `summitt-dweller-DO-docker` and https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal(https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal) which I recently forked to [https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal](https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal).

My attempt to get my `wieting-lando` Drupal code up and working at _DigitalOcean_ per the instructions in [Installation and configuration](https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal#installation-and-configuration) working as `administrator` on `summitt-dweller-DO-docker` looks like this:

```
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt
╰─$ git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal.git
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt
╰─$ cd docker-compose-drupal
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹master›
╰─$ git checkout -b wieting
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹wieting›
╰─$ cp docker-compose.tpl.yml docker-compose.yml\ncp default.env .env
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹wieting›
╰─$ nano .env   # to make recommended edits
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹wieting›
╰─$ nano docker-compose.yml   # to make recommended edits
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹wieting›
╰─$ docker-compose config   # to check the config...good to go
```

Then from `MA8660`...

```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub/wieting-lando ‹ruby-2.3.0› ‹master*›
╰─$ rsync -aruvi . administrator@104.248.237.235:/opt/docker-compose-drupal/drupal/. --progress
```

Then back on `summitt-dweller-DO-docker`...

```
╭─administrator@summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/docker-compose-drupal ‹wieting›
╰─$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

But this command failed because of two issues:

  - `Cannot start service portainer: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint wieting-portainer` - _Portainer_ is already running on this node, we don't need it again!
  - `Cannot start service nginx: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint wieting-nginx` - Sure, port 80 is already occupied...we need some _Traefik_ magic here!

First step... remove (comment out) the `portainer` service in `docker-compose.yml`, and bring back the `dashboard` service just to see how it works.  

Next step... add some _Traefik_ labels and port assignments (see `summitt-dweller-DO-docker /opt/omeka-s2/docker-compose.yml` for examples) to our `docker-compose.yml` to aleviate the `nginx` port conflict issues.

# ^^^ Do As He Says ^^^

<!--
## Next Step...Ensure That I Can Deploy to `summitt-dweller-DO-docker`

Taking a look at the aforementioned server indicates 3 services running under a _Traefik_ reverse-proxy that serves [https://Wieting.TamaToledo.net](https://Wieting.TamaToledo.net).  The services are:

  - wodby/drupal-php:7.1-dev-4.4.2   "/docker-entrypoint.…"  9000/tcp  wieting_php
  - wodby/drupal-nginx:8-1.13-4.1.0  "/docker-entrypoint.…"  80/tcp    wieting_nginx
  - wodby/mariadb:10.2-3.1.3         "/docker-entrypoint.…"  3306/tcp  wieting_mariadb

That looks a lot like what I have locally with _Lando_.  Now if I can find a "production-capable" stack with a similar architecture...  Hmmm, what about https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal?  I'll have to check that out next.

Check the LOCATION printed below if you are unsure where to go.

Oh... and here are some vitals:

 RECIPE    drupal8
 DOCS      https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/drupal8.html

╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ atom .
```

I edited my `.lando.yml` file as directed using _Atom_, so that it looks like this:

```
name: wieting
recipe: drupal8
config:
  webroot: htdocs
  php: '7.2'
  via: nginx
  database: mariadb
  xdebug: true
```

Then...

```

## Departing From the `norweigian.blue` Script

I found that the [https://norwegian.blue/node/86](https://norwegian.blue/node/86) script got a little messy around Step 7, so borrowing guidance from [Composer template for Drupal projects](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) I changed things up a bit, like so:

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal8 --no-interaction

```

 This seems to have worked nicely, putting my _Drupal_ installation in a sub-directory of the project at `drupal8`.  However, this takes `drush`, and perhaps other tools, out of the `appserver` container's `$PATH` and that's not gonna work.

Aha! Me thinks the solution to this problem lies in the [Lando - Drupal 8 - Using Drush](https://docs.lando.dev/config/drupal8.html#using-drush) documentation.


 So I edited the new `composer.json` using _Atom_, adding two new lines to the `extra:installer-paths` key, like so:

```
  "web/themes/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-theme"],
  "web/modules/custom/{$name}": ["type:drupal-custom-module"]
```

 Then I did...

 ```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ cd drupal8                    
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8

   ...
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ chmod u+w web/sites/default    # See https://www.drupal.org/forum/support/post-installation/2019-12-09/fresh-install-drupal-880-composer-require-could-not
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando composer update   
```

Once this was done I went back to the [https://norwegian.blue/node/86](https://norwegian.blue/node/86) script, Step 7.3 (the numbering here is a little wonky, but it's the `ln -s drupal...` command).

## Back On Script

As mentioned above, I'm back on the script and proceeding like so...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal-8.x
╰─$ cd ..
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ ln -s drupal8/web htdocs
```

A visit to [http://wieting.lndo.site](http://wieting.lndo.site) takes me to the _Drupal_ install page as intended.

## But `drush` is Broken!

This approach appears to work, thus far, but `drush` is broken in the process.  When I attempt to run a `lando drush status` command, or even run `drush` inside the `appserver` container, I get something like...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando drush status              
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:346: starting container process caused "exec: \"drush\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown
```

A closer look shows...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando ssh                             
www-data@c00c2bca5d75:/app/drupal8$ echo $PATH
/app/vendor/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/var/www/.composer/vendor/bin
www-data@c00c2bca5d75:/app/drupal8$ cd /app/vendor/bin
bash: cd: /app/vendor/bin: No such file or directory
```

So the `$PATH` in the container is wrong, it should include `/app/druapl8/vendor/bin`.  I posted about this in _Lando_'s _Slack_ #community channel and got back a conversation that begins [here](https://devwithlando.slack.com/archives/C2XBSHX8R/p1582142751438800).  

It's suggested that I can fix this by adding the following to my `.lando.yml` file, my "Landofile":

```
tooling:
  drush:
    cmd:  /app/drupal8/vendor/bin/drush  
```

So I added that and tried `lando drush status` again, but got the same error.  I'm going to do a `lando rebuild`, as suggested, and see if that helps.  Nope, but further investigation shows me that `drush` isn't installed at all, so...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando composer require drush/drush
```

...and then...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal8
╰─$ lando drush status
 Drupal version : 8.8.2
 Site URI       : http://default
 PHP binary     : /usr/local/bin/php
 PHP config     :
 PHP OS         : Linux
 Drush script   : /app/drupal8/vendor/drush/drush/drush
 Drush version  : 10.2.1
 Drush temp     : /tmp
 Drush configs  : /app/drupal8/vendor/drush/drush/drush.yml
 Drupal root    : /app/drupal8/web
 Site path      : sites/default
```

It works!

## But _Drupal Console_ Does Not!

So, running `lando drupal about` does not work, but after a `lando ssh` and some poking around inside the container, I find that running `drupal about` from `/app` shows that the console lives at `/app/drupal/vendor/drupal/console/bin/drupal`.  Let's set that path in `.lando.yml` by adding a new `drupal:cmd` key like so:

```
tooling:
  drush:
    cmd:  /app/drupal8/vendor/bin/drush
  drupal:
    cmd: /app/drupal/vendor/drupal/console/bin/drupal
```

Nope, but let's do another `lando rebuild` and try again.  




I'm going to fix that from within like so...

```


So, I completed entries on that page as instructed, and voila!  The site is up, but bland.  Next steps were largely per the script, but started with bringing a copy of my previously exported `wieting` database into the project like so...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ cp -fr ~/GitHub/.out-of-the-way/wieting-lando2/init-db.d .
```

Then per the script...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando ‹master*›

```




Now, to make the project recognize the new database I need to edit, using _Atom_, my 'settings.php' file, that's `./drupal-8.x/web/sites/default/settings.php`.  In that file I change my `default` database settings to match the contents of the database I just imported.  Specifically...

```
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => 'wieting',
  'username' => 'drupal',
  'password' => '-> obfuscated <-',
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => 'database',
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);
```

Now let's see what we have at [http://wieting.lndo.site](http://wieting.lndo.site)?  **Yes!** That's progress!

## The Config Directory is Empty

So, checking `settings.php` I find, true to form, that the `../config/sync` directory is empty.  That's not right.  Lets go get our last working configuration...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/drupal-8.x
╰─$ rsync -aruvi ~/GitHub/wieting-docksal/config/sync/. . --progress
  ...

```
 And attempt to apply it with a restart like so:

 ```








## Geerling's Way

So, following Jeff's lead, I'll begin like so:

```

## Before I Forget

I found [Lando's "Drupal 8" documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/drupal8.html#drupal-8) to be especially helpful for these next steps.  That documentation draws particular attention to the `.lando.yml` file, the "Landofile" in the project root.  Let's have a look...

Wow, that "Landofile" is pretty sparse which just means there are LOTS of default values in play here.  The `composer.json` is pretty standard for an initial _Drupal 8_ site too.  I'm going to use the documentation to override some of the "Landofile", and see if I can introduce my own `composer.json` too, using [Atom](https://atom.io), like so:

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/lando-d8 ‹wieting*›
╰─$ atom .
```

I'll document the changes I made above once I'm all done here, but for now suffice it to say that I visited [https://wieting.lndo.site](http://wieting.lndo.site) and got redirected to [http://wieting.lndo.site/core/install.php](http://wieting.lndo.site/core/install.php) to install the site as expected.

## Bringing My Own Database

[The documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/drupal8.html#importing-your-database) says that I should be able to import my own database like so:

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/lando-d8 ‹wieting*›
╰─$ cp -f ../wieting/backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql .
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/lando-d8 ‹wieting*›
╰─$ lando db-import backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql
Preparing to import /app/backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql into lemp on localhost:3306 as root...

NOTE: See the --no-wipe flag to avoid this step!
Dropping ban_ip table from lemp database...
...
Dropping watchdog table from lemp database...
Importing /app/backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql...

Import complete!
```

## Bringing My Own `settings.php`

Since the database import wasn't enough, let's make sure we have our trusty old `settings.php` file too:

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/lando-d8 ‹wieting*›
╰─$ cp -f ../wieting/web/sites/default/settings.php sites/default/.
```

Using _Atom_ again I made one necessary change in the `databases` key by changing `'host' => 'db'` to `'host' => 'database'` inside `settings.php`.

## Adding My Own Composer Parts










First step, on my iMac workstation, `MA8660`, is to clone the _Docksal_ work that I've done thus far:

```
╭─markmcfate@ma8660 ~/GitHub ‹ruby-2.3.0›

╰─$ lando init
[1]    6483 killed     lando init
```

Whoa, what happened there? `Traps` happened.  The software that GC employs to protect endpoints is blocking execution of `lando`.  So I've filed another ticket to get that resolved...soon, I hope.  :frowning:

# And Now For Something Completely Different...

Actually, not so different, but working from my home office now, where `lando` can run free!  So, from my Mac Mini at home...

# Before I Forget

I found [Lando's "Drupal 8" documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/config/drupal8.html#drupal-8) to be especially helpful for these next steps.

# Progress Report

The result of the actions documented above... a _Drupal_ 8.8.2 framework for creation of a new site at [http://wieting.lndo.site/core/install.php](http://wieting.lndo.site/core/install.php).  But, that's not entirely what I had in mind, so what's missing?  A little sleuthing inside the `wieting_appserver_1` container shows me that the first missing component is a proper `/var/www/web/sites/default/settings.php` file.  The one that _Lando_ initialized has only the default values for things...no database!  And why would that be the case?  Because my `wieting-docksal` repository on _GitHub_ has no such file.  Let's fix that by bringing the stack down, and introducing a proper file into this new project...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ lando stop
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ cd web/sites/default
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando/web/sites/default
╰─$ cp -f ~/GitHub/wieting-docksal/web/sites/default/settings.php .
```

Based on the documentation, we need to make at least one small change to our `settings.php`, the database host name in a _Lando_ stack should be `database`, not `db`.

Having made that one change, lets start the stack again...

```

# Importing the Database

The `backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql` in my project root is a .mysql dump of my previous `wieting-docksal` work and should do nicely as an import to this new framework. According to the [Importing Your Database](https://docs.lando.dev/config/drupal8.html#importing-your-database) portion of the documentation, I should be able to import this database like so:

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ lando db-import backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql
Preparing to import /app/backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql into lemp on localhost:3306 as root...
Destroying all current tables in lemp...
NOTE: See the --no-wipe flag to avoid this step!
Importing /app/backup-2020-02-14T15-06-09.mysql...

Import complete!
```

# OK, WHat Do We Have Now?

Nope, the stack is still prompting me to create a new site, but why?  Well, the [ssh](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/ssh.html#ssh) portion of the documentation says I can open a terminal inside any container, so lets try...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Mac-Mini ~/GitHub/wieting-lando
╰─$ lando ssh bash
www-data@4609ebe2804e:/app$
```

We're in!  And I see one potential problem, our `settings.php` file still has open permissions, like so:

```
www-data@4609ebe2804e:/app/web/sites/default$ ls -alh
total 72K
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data dialout  192 Feb 16 06:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data dialout  192 Feb 16 05:34 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data dialout 6.7K Feb 16 05:34 default.services.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data dialout  30K Feb 16 05:34 default.settings.php
drwxrwxrwx 2 www-data dialout   64 Feb 16 06:22 files
-rw-rw-rw- 1 www-data dialout  30K Feb 16 06:22 settings.php
```

Let's fix that and see what happens...

```
www-data@4609ebe2804e:/app/web/sites/default$ chmod 444 settings.php
```

Still no joy.  :frowning:



So, according to the documentation, we should be able to run `drush` like so:

```
cd web/sites/default
lando drush status
```


to import it using `drush`...

```

-->

And that's...promising.  I'll be back.  :smile:
