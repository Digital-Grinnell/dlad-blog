| Attention! |
| --- |
| The Docksal portion of this discussion DID NOT WORK PROPERLY so I've hidden it from public view.  Don't use this project with Docksal (`fin` commands) until further notice! |

<!--
Please pay no attention to the [Docksal](https://docksal.io) portions of my previous [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/ss) blog [post 030](https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/030-dockerized-omeka-s-starting-over/)... it is fatally flawed! It doesn't "properly" build an Omeka-S environment in Docksal, but that is what this post will attempt to do.

As mentioned in earlier posts, I've created a fork of [dodeeric/omeka-s-docker](https://github.com/dodeeric/omeka-s-docker) at [DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker), and I'll be working in a new `docksal-proper` branch of that work here.

## Proper "Docksal-ization"
In this post I'm going to try to do this "properly", by following the guidance that's specific to the [Configuration: Dockerfile](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#docker-file) portion of the Docksal documentation.  Essentially I'm going to "borrow" the key elements of the [dodeeric/omeka-s-docker Dockerfile](https://github.com/dodeeric/omeka-s-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) and integrate them into Docksal's `cli` service in similar fashion to [this example](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#docker-file).

## Creating a New `cli` Dockerfile
The first, and most significant, step in this process was to do as the documentation says and create a new `Dockerfile` to "extend" `cli`.  I did this like so:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/omeka-s-docker; <br/> git checkout -b docksal-proper <br/> mkdir -p .docksal/services/cli <br/> cp -f Dockerfile ./docksal/services/cli/Dockerfile <br/> atom . |

In case you haven't seen me do this before, that last `atom .` command simply opens the entire project directory in my [Atom](https://atom.io) editing environment.  Slick.  Next step was to edit my new `Dockerfile` and experiment with it a bit.  At the very top of the file I made one essential change, replacing this:

```
FROM php:apache

# Omeka-S web publishing platform for digital heritage collections (https://omeka.org/s/)
# Initial maintainer: Oldrich Vykydal (o1da) - Klokan Technologies GmbH  
MAINTAINER Eric Dodemont <eric.dodemont@skynet.be>
```
...with this:
```
FROM docksal/cli:2-php7.2
# FROM php:apache

# Omeka-S web publishing platform for digital heritage collections (https://omeka.org/s/)
# Initial maintainer: Oldrich Vykydal (o1da) - Klokan Technologies GmbH  
# Dockerized by: Eric Dodemont <eric.dodemont@skynet.be>
MAINTAINER Mark McFate <mcfatem@grinnell.edu>
```

I let the rest of the `Dockerfile` stand as-is, just to see what will, or will not, happen.  Since the project already has a `.docksal/docksal.yml` with a history of changes, I moved that to a new `.docksal/out-of-the-way/` directory just to get a fresh start, like so:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/omeka-s-docker; <br/> git checkout docksal-proper <br/> mkdir -p .docksal/out-of-the-way <br/> mv -f ./.docksal/docksal.yml .docksal/out-of-the-way/ |

## First Launch
Let's see what happens... `fin up`!

The outcome was not too bad, not too bad at all.  From the `fin up` output I gleaned this significant (?) info:

```
Pulling db (docksal/mysql:5.6-1.4)...
Pulling cli (docksal/cli:2.6-php7.2)...

Creating omeka-s-docker_cli_1 ... done
Creating omeka-s-docker_db_1  ... done
Creating omeka-s-docker_web_1 ... done
```
I'm not sure if those versions of things will work, but they should not be hard to upgrade if necessary.  I am *encouraged* by the fact that we have only the 3 "standard" Docksal containers running, with no mysterious "extras".  :smile:

When I visited the prompted address in my browser, the `install` script came right up, but produced this output:

```
Some installation requirements were not satisfied.

    "/var/www/html/files" is not a writable directory.
    An exception occured in driver: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'omeka'@'192.168.160.2' (using password: YES)
```

I'm not surprised by that first issue... and it should be easy to resolve.  The 2nd issue I have seen before, and I think all that's needed are some proper database username and password settings; that can happen in the `docksal.yml` file.

## Second Launch
So, based on that first experience let's bring back the lean `docksal.yml` file from the old `docksal` branch with just database credentials in it.  


So, I think the reported `"/var/www/html/files" is not a writable directory` message is because the new `Dockerfile` does this:

```
...
&& rm -Rf /var/www/html/files/ \
&& ln -s /var/www/html/volume/files/ /var/www/html/files \
...
```
This basically blows away the "default" `files` directory and replaces it with a symbolic link, so the directory that it links to has to exist, and it exists as part of the `omeka:` Docker volume created above.

Let's see if this will fly... `fin up`!


<!--

If your workstation is able to run the aforementioned required components then the following steps can be used to launch and develop a local instance.  Assuming your workstation is Linux or a Mac, you'll need to edit your `/etc/hosts` with an editor of your choice, and `sudo` privileges might be required.  For me this was...

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

In the `/etc/hosts` file comment out any line beginning with `127.0.0.1` and add the following two lines just above it...
```
### For omeka-s-docker
127.0.0.1    localhost omeka.localdomain pma.localdomain gramps.localdomain
```
The new `127.0.0.1...` line will enable you to use `http://omeka.localdomain` to open and work with your new Omeka-S instance in any browser on your workstation.

Now to launch Omeka-S, return to your workstation terminal and...

```
cd ~/Projects    # or any path of your choice
git clone https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker.git
cd omeka-s-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose up -d` command in this sequence should launch the project locally.  Once it is complete you should be able to open any browser and visit `http://omeka.localdomain` to work with Omeka-S, or `http://pma.localdomain` if you want PHPMyAdmin.

## Capturing the Configuration
So, having successfully started my new, local Omeka-S stack with `docker-compose up -d`, I wanted to visit the primary container and capture all of the pristine Omeka-S config and code.  The project does NOT map the document root to a persistent directory on the host, so to capture it I did this:

| Workstation Commands |
| --- |
| cd ~/Projects/omeka-s-docker; <br/> mkdir html; <br/> docker cp omeka-s-docker_omeka_1:/var/www/html/. ./html/ |

The last command above, `docker cp...`, is the key.  It copies the established docroot, '/var/www/html', from inside the Omeka container, out to the new `./html` directory on host.

## Adding a Custom Docksal Configuration
Having successfully captured a pristine Omeka-S docroot, I executed a `fin config generate` command on the host from my `~/Projects/omeka-s-docker` project directory.  The result was this:
```
╭─mark@Marks-Air.grinnell.edu ~/Projects/omeka-s-docker  ‹docksal*›
╰─➤  fin config generate
DOCROOT has been detected as html. Is that correct? [y/n]: y
Configuration was generated. You can start it with fin project start
```
Following the prompted suggestion, I then executed `fin project start` and the stack did come alive.  However, when I visit http://omeka-s-docker.docksal I get an "Internal Server Error" page, probably because my database config isn't right yet?  I subsequently did `fin logs` at my command prompt and got back...

```
╭─mark@Marks-Air.grinnell.edu ~/Projects/omeka-s-docker  ‹docksal*›
╰─➤  fin logs

```  

The `web_1... Invalid command 'php_value'` looks odd so I opened the `./html/.htaccess` file on the host and commented out the last two lines (where the `php_value` statements were). I was also concerned that this configuration doesn't specify any database name or credentials, so following [this documentation](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#extend-docksal.yml) I added to `./.docksal/docksal.yml` in the project directory so that it now has  the following initial content:

```
version: "2.1"

services:
  db:
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: omeka
      MYSQL_USER: omeka
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: omeka
```

Then a new `fin up` and http://omeka-s-docker.docksal successfully **opened the Omeka install page!**  

# Woot!
I'm pushing the latest changes to the `docksal` branch of https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/omeka-s-docker NOW!

NOT a wrap.  As Arnold Schwarzenegger would say: "I'll be back!"
