A `fin ps` command shows all the stack containers are up and healthy...

# What Follows Has Been Abandoned as Obsolete!
At least for now...

I suspect the problem is with the database connection to Omeka, and I can imagine at least two possible issues:
  1. In Docksal the database container/service is named `db`, but in the Omeka stack it is `mariadb`.
  2. In the Omeka stack, the `mariadb` service includes a set of environment variables that govern things like the root password, database name, and database user credentials.  This is almost certainly different in the Docksal environment.

So, following [this documentation](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#extend-docksal.yml) I've attempted to address issue 2 by creating a new `./.docksal/docksal.yml` file in the project directory with the following initial content:

```
version: "2.1"

services:
  db:
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: blabla
      MYSQL_DATABASE: omeka
      MYSQL_USER: omeka
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: omeka
```

Doing a new `fin up` and things have changed, but now `fin ps` shows the `omeka-s-docker_db_1` container to be "unhealthy" :frown:.

```

Per the [documentation](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#docker-file) I made a duplicate of the project's original `./Dockerfile` and put the new copy in `./.docksal/services/cli/Dockerfile`.  Then I replaced the initial `FROM...` statement in the new file with a copy pulled from the documentation, so we have this...

```
## Replacing one 'FROM...' line below with three lines that follow it from https://docs.docksal.io/stack/extend-images/#docker-file.  MAM 25-July-2019
#FROM php:apache  
# Note how we use cli:2 here, which refers the latest available 2.x version
# So that we wouldn't need to update this every time new version of Docksal cli releases
FROM docksal/cli:2-php7.2
```
Also, in `./.docksal/docksal.env` I changed the DOCROOT to `/var/www/html`.

Trying `fin up`...


And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
