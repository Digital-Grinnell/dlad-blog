This text is for guidance only, be sure to replace it with the real thing!  Also, make sure you properly set the front matter (the stuff between the --- marks above).  

- Enter your own title.
- Properly set the date.  Note that in its current form my Atom configuration should automatically update `date` or `lastmod` entry, but not the `publishdate`.
- Remove the `draft` key or change its value to `false` when you are ready to publish the post.

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
