title: Bleve Search - Note to Self
---

Had a conversation about lots of topics this afternoon and bumped into [Bleve Search](https://blevesearch.com/) along the way, including a discussion about [adding search capability to a Hugo site](https://blevesearch.com/news/Site-Search/).  I think in the near future I'll have a look at adding such a feature to this blog, and perhaps to the [Visualizing Abolition and Freedom](https://vaf.grinnell.edu) site too!

And that's a wrap.  Until next time...
