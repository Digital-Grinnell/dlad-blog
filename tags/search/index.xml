That old search mechanism used Fuse, which has NO dependencies, but that old scheme used a Hugo theme component that I found difficult to properly maintain. So, as this blog was moving to Azure I elected to try something a little different with Fuse and found this gist to help get it done.
As of this writing, the new search is limited to just finding tag references, and sometimes a search will return a 404 error because of a bad path reference.</description></item><item><title>How to Add a Collection to Digital.Grinnell</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/084-how-to-add-a-collection-to-digital-grinnell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/084-how-to-add-a-collection-to-digital-grinnell/</guid><description>So, you want to add a new collection or sub-collection (they are really the same thing) to Digital.Grinnell, eh? It&amp;rsquo;s easy, but there are some things to consider before I show you how.
Collection Guidelines There are no &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; guidelines for the creation of a collection or sub-collection in Digital.Grinnell, but I can think of a couple &amp;ldquo;informal&amp;rdquo; things to consider.
Are there or will there ever be enough objects, old and/or new, with something in common to warrant a new collection?</description></item></channel></rss>
