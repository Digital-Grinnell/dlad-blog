That old search mechanism used &lt;a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse&lt;/a>, which has NO dependencies, but that old scheme used a &lt;em>Hugo&lt;/em> theme component that I found difficult to properly maintain. So, as this blog was moving to &lt;em>Azure&lt;/em> I elected to try something a little different with &lt;em>Fuse&lt;/em> and found &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/gtrevg/a34e0c736d358771437be05c6401e86c">this gist&lt;/a> to help get it done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of this writing, the new search is limited to just finding &lt;code>tag&lt;/code> references, and sometimes a search will return a 404 error because of a bad path reference. If you try to search and get the 404 error have a look at the returned URL and if it reads like &lt;code>.../search/search?search-query...&lt;/code> then you&amp;rsquo;ve got one too many instances of the term &lt;code>search&lt;/code>. Remove that first &lt;code>/search&lt;/code> term, including the slash in front of it, and hit return. The search should now return valid results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Add a Collection to Digital.Grinnell</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/084-how-to-add-a-collection-to-digital-grinnell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/084-how-to-add-a-collection-to-digital-grinnell/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, you want to add a new collection or sub-collection (they are really the same thing) to &lt;a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu">Digital.Grinnell&lt;/a>, eh? It&amp;rsquo;s easy, but there are some things to consider before I show you how.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="collection-guidelines">Collection Guidelines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are no &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; guidelines for the creation of a collection or sub-collection in &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em>, but I can think of a couple &amp;ldquo;informal&amp;rdquo; things to consider.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Are there or will there ever be enough objects, old and/or new, with something in common to warrant a new collection? How many is &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo;? I dunno, but anything fewer than a dozen individual objects is borderline at best, at least in my book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
