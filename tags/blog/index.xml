All of the content, aka &amp;lsquo;posts&amp;rsquo;, from my old blog have been moved here, but there are still lots of remnants of the new theme, Zzo, lurking here. Please be patient with this new format while I work to fully implement all the features that this setup provides.
Also, thank you, Mackenzie. My daughter played an important role in helping me with this transition.
And it&amp;rsquo;s time to do some real work&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to share more here soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
