&lt;h2 id="digitalgrinnell-objects">Digital.Grinnell Objects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last couple of years I have deposited some 477 digital objects, mostly JPEG images and PDFs, into &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em> so they could be &amp;ldquo;served&amp;rdquo; up for &lt;a href="https://rootstalk.grinnell.edu">&lt;em>Rootstalk&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I did this because at the time &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> FEDORA repository was available and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, &lt;em>DG&lt;/em> isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or responsive as it once was since its FEDORA is due to be retired in a year or two. Also, the objects had to be made available to the public so they are &amp;ldquo;visible&amp;rdquo; to &lt;em>Rootstalk&lt;/em>, but that also makes them discoverable by the public, even though they are essentially out-of-context in &lt;em>DG&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
