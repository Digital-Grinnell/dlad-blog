Digital.Grinnell Objects Over the last couple of years I have deposited some 477 digital objects, mostly JPEG images and PDFs, into Digital.Grinnell so they could be &amp;ldquo;served&amp;rdquo; up for Rootstalk. I did this because at the time Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s FEDORA repository was available and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, DG isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or responsive as it once was since its FEDORA is due to be retired in a year or two.</description></item></channel></rss>
