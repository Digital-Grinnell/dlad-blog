That&amp;rsquo;s the old, and by that I mean VERY OLD, like &lt;em>Drupal v6&lt;/em> vintage from 2012 or 2013, form for an object address. All such references were to some of &lt;em>DG&lt;/em>&amp;rsquo;s oldest digital objects, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We tried to figure out where such old address references might be coming from, but we struck out. I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to back-track a request like that given today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/gdpr-privacy-policy/">GDPR&lt;/a> environment and related privacy practices?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
