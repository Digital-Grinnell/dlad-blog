The information I found initially was not what I expected to encounter, and that left me scratching my head just a bit. Fortunately, a colleague at the ICG came through with the needed information and I immediately added it to my list of key resources. You can find those resources in my OneTab at:
https://www.one-tab.com/page/9OatzLo-TB6XuuizqbGrwA And that&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; break. I hope to add some details, and more links, when I return.</description></item><item><title>Compact Build of dg.localdomain - Concise Instructions</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/094-compact-build-of-dg.localdomain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/094-compact-build-of-dg.localdomain/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to an earlier post, Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - with Annotations, where I exhaustively documented my workflow for building a local/development instance of ISLE to mimic the behavoir of Digital.Grinnell.
Goal The goal of this project is to present a repeatable, minimal set of instructions for spinning up a safe, stand-alone, local/development instance of ISLE on any Mac running OS X.
Prerequisites This document assumes the user will be spinning up https://dg.localdomain on a Mac with a suitable DG-FEDORA USB stick mounted and accessible.</description></item><item><title>ISLE Workflow Test</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/060-isle-workflow-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/060-isle-workflow-test/</guid><description>ISLE v1.3.0 has been running on my staging server, DGDockerX, for about 6 weeks now and it seems to be performing as-expected with one exception&amp;hellip; when I try to import a batch of objects using IMI, the Islandora Multi-Importer, I get the following error:
The website encountered an unexpected error. Please try again later. An examination of Recent log messages shows&amp;hellip;
GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException: cURL error 6: Could not resolve host: sheets.googleapis.com (see https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html) in GuzzleHttp\Handler\CurlFactory::createRejection() (line 200 of /var/www/html/sites/all/modules/islandora/islandora_multi_importer/vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Handler/CurlFactory.php). Engaging the Local Workflow Since I&amp;rsquo;m not at all sure what&amp;rsquo;s wrong, I feel like I need to rewind my process a bit and try to reproduce the same configuration, and error, on a local instance of this ISLE stack.</description></item></channel></rss>
