What&amp;rsquo;s IHC, you ask?
IHC is my Islandora Health Check drush command/module. Since this is a note to myself, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get into a lot of detail here, just posting some reminders so I can remember how it works and how it is used.
What Is It? IHC is a module that provides drush commands that can be used to collect (drush ihcC), analyze (drush ihcA), and subsequently report (drush ihcR) key object info from DG&amp;rsquo;s FEDORA repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
