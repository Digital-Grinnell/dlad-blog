In order to accommodate that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved nearly all of the sites and services from that droplet to my other, summitt-dweller-DO-docker. The site migration was a smooth process except for https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com. That Drupal 8 site has been difficult to upgrade and migrate largely because it was deployed using my old Port-Ability scripts, and about a year ago I scrapped Port-Ability in favor of Docksal, but I never got around to moving that particular site to a Docksal environment.</description></item><item><title>Omeka-S in Docksal</title><link>/posts/039-omeka-s-in-docksal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/039-omeka-s-in-docksal/</guid><description>Attention! The Docksal portion of this discussion DID NOT WORK PROPERLY so I&amp;rsquo;ve hidden it from public view. Don&amp;rsquo;t use this project with Docksal (fin commands) until further notice! git checkout -b docksal-proper mkdir -p .docksal/services/cli cp -f Dockerfile ./docksal/services/cli/Dockerfile atom . | In case you haven't seen me do this before, that last `atom .` command simply opens the entire project directory in my [Atom](https://atom.io) editing environment.</description></item><item><title>Building Grocy in Docksal</title><link>/posts/036-building-grocy-in-docksal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/036-building-grocy-in-docksal/</guid><description>Grocy looks lika a great little PHP stack application for me. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to help folks organize and inventory their &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, with a slant toward food and groceries. I need this!
Since I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Docker and Docksal, naturally I wanted to spin Grocy up in one of these environments. Thankfully, the heavy lifting of getting this &amp;ldquo;Dockerized&amp;rdquo; has already been done, and that fine work is shared in GitHub at grocy/grocy-docker. So my quest last evening started with a fork of this GitHub project to SummittDweller/grocy-docker, where I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new docksal branch.</description></item><item><title>A Blog is Born</title><link>/posts/001-a-blog-is-born/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/001-a-blog-is-born/</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how a blog is born? The story behind this blog begins with my interest in stepping back from the CMS world, primarily Drupal, to discover the joys of static site generation. The journey begins in earnest at the 2016 DLF Forum: Milwaukee on the eve of the United States' 2016 national election, when all the buzz that wasn&amp;rsquo;t political, was about building static web sites, and Jekyll.
A few weeks after the DLF Forum this server was born, thanks to the my colleagues in the Grinnell College (GC) Libraries, and Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s Information Technology Services (ITS) department.</description></item></channel></rss>
