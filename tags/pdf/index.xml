But this post has nothing to do with those things so I need to clear my head and press on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A WARC is essentially a file format used to capture the content and organization of a web site. Recently, I was asked to add a pair of WARCs to &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em>.

FULL_TEXT datastreams are required to make PDF, and similar text content, searchable and discoverable in &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to confirm that the lack of OCR was in fact the problem, I ran a little test on &lt;a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell:26702">https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell:26702&lt;/a>, one of the 21 objects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
