The development of this blog post, and modifications to the https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-issue-workflow repo, took place on my personal Mac Mini while simultaneous work on Rootstalk was completed in the ~/GitHub/npm-rootstalk AND ~/GitHub/rootstalk-issue-workflow* local repositories on my Grinnell College MacBook Pro. The two machines shared a single keyboard and mouse, plus copy/paste capabilities, via Universal Control.
*Note that work in ~/GitHub/roostalk-issue-workflow must be completed on my GC-issued MacBook Pro as access to InDesign is only available on that college-owned machine.</description></item><item><title>NPM to Rule Them All</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/145-npm-to-rule-them-all/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 11:43:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/145-npm-to-rule-them-all/</guid><description>NPM for the Win, EVERYWHERE My first experiences with the EVERYWHERE component of this subject involved my personal blog and then Rootstalk.
