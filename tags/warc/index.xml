The website content of interest included material describing plans for the recently-completed HSSC and Administration Building projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the restoration and WARC process a &lt;code>.md&lt;/code> document named &lt;code>WARC-from-comm.sites.grinnell.edu-clone.md&lt;/code> was created and it&amp;rsquo;s contents are presented here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In July 2022 a new &amp;ldquo;clone&amp;rdquo; of the original &lt;code>comm.sites.grinnell.edu&lt;/code> web site project &amp;ndash; a &lt;em>Wordpress&lt;/em> copy that contains posts and supporting information regarding campus construction projects including the HSSC and Adminissions Center &amp;ndash; was created. That clone can be found, and administered, from &lt;a href="https://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/clone/wp-admin/index.php">https://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/clone/wp-admin/index.php&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Here There Be WARCs</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/082-here-there-be-warcs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/082-here-there-be-warcs/</guid><description>&lt;p>The term &lt;code>WARC&lt;/code>, an abbreviation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive">Web ARChive&lt;/a>, always reminds me of things like hobbits, elves, dark lords, and orcs, of course. But this post has nothing to do with those things so I need to clear my head and press on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A WARC is essentially a file format used to capture the content and organization of a web site. Recently, I was asked to add a pair of WARCs to &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em>. Doing so proved to be quite an adventure, but I am pleased to report that we now have these two objects to show for it:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
