Locally, and in staging I&amp;rsquo;ve debugged the code that is responsible for removing the temporary file once the operation is complete. Running locally or in staging the process does its job, the temporary files get deleted soon after creation, but this never happens in production.</description></item><item><title>301 Redirect in Digital.Grinnell</title><link>/posts/104-301-redirect-in-digital.grinnell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 10:28:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/104-301-redirect-in-digital.grinnell/</guid><description>A colleague and I were recently sifting through the Digital.Grinnell logs and came across some recurring 404, &amp;ldquo;page not found&amp;rdquo;, status messages. 404&amp;rsquo;s are not uncommon in DG, but these were particularly troubling because they were requests of the form drupal/fedora/repository/grinnell:162 and drupal/fedora/repository/grinnell:86. That&amp;rsquo;s the old, and by that I mean VERY OLD, like Drupal v6 vintage from 2012 or 2013, form for an object address. All such references were to some of DG&amp;rsquo;s oldest digital objects, too.
We tried to figure out where such old address references might be coming from, but we struck out.</description></item></channel></rss>
