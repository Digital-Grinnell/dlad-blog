&lt;p>Late last night (don&amp;rsquo;t ask how late it was) I discovered a really slick trick, aka &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo;, of &lt;em>docker-compose&lt;/em>. Full disclosure: I love &lt;em>docker-compose&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;overrides&amp;rdquo;, a feature I found a couple of months ago. However, implementing overrides in a granular fashion, as I&amp;rsquo;d like, and within a &lt;em>docker-compose&lt;/em> hierarchy of environments like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE">ISLE&lt;/a> stack, can be difficult and counter-productive. I may have found a workable compromise last night. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, please, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history">History&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>About a year ago I created a &amp;ldquo;portable&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>FEDORA&lt;/em> object repository &amp;ldquo;on a stick&amp;rdquo;, a USB stick. I call that &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>DG-FEDORA&lt;/em>, because it contains a number of sample objects gleaned from &lt;a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu">Digital.Grinnell.edu&lt;/a>. Shortly after I created the &amp;ldquo;stick&amp;rdquo; I started using a &lt;em>docker-compose.override.yml&lt;/em> file (see &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends#adding-and-overriding-configuration">Adding and overriding configuration&lt;/a> for details) to implement it in some of my &lt;em>ISLE&lt;/em> work. But there were lots of other &amp;ldquo;customizations&amp;rdquo; that I also wanted to implement, and over time my &lt;em>docker-compose.override.yml&lt;/em> grew too large to be easily maintained&amp;hellip;there was just too much stuff to squeeze into a file that was supposed to make life easier.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
