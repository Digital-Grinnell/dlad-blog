The development of this blog post, and modifications to the https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-issue-workflow repo, took place on my personal Mac Mini while simultaneous work on Rootstalk was completed in the ~/GitHub/npm-rootstalk AND ~/GitHub/rootstalk-issue-workflow* local repositories on my Grinnell College MacBook Pro. The two machines shared a single keyboard and mouse, plus copy/paste capabilities, via Universal Control.
*Note that work in ~/GitHub/roostalk-issue-workflow must be completed on my GC-issued MacBook Pro as access to InDesign is only available on that college-owned machine.</description></item><item><title>Automated Proofreading with `htmlproofer`</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/133-automated-proofreading-with-htmlproofer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/133-automated-proofreading-with-htmlproofer/</guid><description>What follows is a January 2022 excerpt from a piece of Rootstalk project documentation titled Automated-Testing.md&amp;hellip;
Automated Testing Today I started a little side-project aimed at helping test or &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; the Rootstalk structure and content. I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to use the package/process documented in this GitHub repo.
I started on the command-line of my MacBook Pro like so:
╭─mcfatem@MAC02FK0XXQ05Q ~/GitHub/rootstalk ‹main› ╰─$ gem install html-proofer Fetching yell-2.2.2.gem Fetching nokogiri-1.13.1-arm64-darwin.gem Fetching rainbow-3.1.1.gem Fetching ethon-0.15.0.gem Fetching html-proofer-3.19.3.gem Fetching typhoeus-1.4.0.gem Fetching parallel-1.21.0.gem Successfully installed yell-2.</description></item></channel></rss>
