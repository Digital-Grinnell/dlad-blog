As of this morning my Synergy solution stopped working and I could not easily get it back in-sync between machines. This has happened before, more than once, and it&amp;rsquo;s largely the reason I abandoned Synergy in favor of Sharemouse. But Sharemouse was plagued with similar issues, and it absolutely didn&amp;rsquo;t work well with VPN active.
The other factor today&amp;hellip; now that my GC iMac has a new &amp;ldquo;assigned identity&amp;rdquo;, I think the old system tag has to be removed from my config because Synergy keeps expecting to find that hostname.</description></item></channel></rss>
