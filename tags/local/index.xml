The effort is coming along, but still, there&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go. Every now and then I come across a feature that we just can&amp;rsquo;t live without, and it&amp;rsquo;s in times like those that I turn to PHPStorm for development and testing. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been operating without PHPStorm in ISLE because I worried that configuring the PHPStorm debugger in a Docker environment would be a time-consuming, tall task.</description></item><item><title>Compact Build of dg.localdomain - Concise Instructions</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/094-compact-build-of-dg.localdomain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/094-compact-build-of-dg.localdomain/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to an earlier post, Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - with Annotations, where I exhaustively documented my workflow for building a local/development instance of ISLE to mimic the behavoir of Digital.Grinnell.
Goal The goal of this project is to present a repeatable, minimal set of instructions for spinning up a safe, stand-alone, local/development instance of ISLE on any Mac running OS X.
Prerequisites This document assumes the user will be spinning up https://dg.localdomain on a Mac with a suitable DG-FEDORA USB stick mounted and accessible.</description></item><item><title>Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - One-Time Customizations</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/090-isle-local-migration-customization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/090-isle-local-migration-customization/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to earlier post 087. It is intended to chronicle my customization efforts, necessary steps that follow the aforementioned document&amp;rsquo;s Step 11, to migrate to a local development instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued iMac, MA8660, currently identified as MAD25W812UJ1G9. Please refer to Steps 0 - 11 in post 087 for background info.
Note that it should NOT be necessary to repeat steps taken in this document. Pertinent changes made herein were saved into a new completed-install-local-migrate branch of my dg-islandora project repository, effectively capturing all progress made within.</description></item><item><title>Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - with Annotations</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to earlier posts 021 and 058, with simiar titles. It is intended to chronicle my efforts to migrate to a local development instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued iMac, MA8660, currently identified as MAD25W812UJ1G9.
Goal The goal of this project is once again to spin up a local Islandora stack using the ISLE project following the guidance of the project&amp;rsquo;s install-local-migrate document. My process will be slightly different than documented since I&amp;rsquo;ve already created a pair of private dg-isle and dg-islandora repositories.</description></item><item><title>ISLE Workflow Test</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/060-isle-workflow-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/060-isle-workflow-test/</guid><description>ISLE v1.3.0 has been running on my staging server, DGDockerX, for about 6 weeks now and it seems to be performing as-expected with one exception&amp;hellip; when I try to import a batch of objects using IMI, the Islandora Multi-Importer, I get the following error:
The website encountered an unexpected error. Please try again later. An examination of Recent log messages shows&amp;hellip;

Engaging the Local Workflow Since I&amp;rsquo;m not at all sure what&amp;rsquo;s wrong, I feel like I need to rewind my process a bit and try to reproduce the same configuration, and error, on a local instance of this ISLE stack.</description></item><item><title>Rebuilding ISLE-ld (for Local Development)</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/058-rebuilding-isle-ld/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/058-rebuilding-isle-ld/</guid><description>This post replaces my earlier post 021 with the same title.
