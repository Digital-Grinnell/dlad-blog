My posts 041, Configuring DGDocker2 and 042, My dockerized-server Config address the original configuration of DGDocker2 in detail.
Omeka-S is configured on DGDocker2 to reside in /opt/omeka-s-docker, and inside that directory is a subdirectory named volume. The portions of the application stack that deliver Omeka-S are configured largely in /opt/omeka-s-docker/docker-compose.</description></item></channel></rss>
