This should be a simple repeat of the process documented in Sync Rootstalk Production (DigitalOcean) with Dev. As before, I used guidance found in How To Merge Between Two Local Repositories to accomplish this.</description></item><item><title>Sync Rootstalk Production (DigitalOcean) with Dev</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/116-sync-rootstalk-production-do-with-dev/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/116-sync-rootstalk-production-do-with-dev/</guid><description>My goal for this morning, December 22, 2021, was to find a process I could reliably use to synchronize changes in the development copy of Rootstalk (the main branch https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk) with our production deployment (the main branch of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-DO) to DigitalOcean. I used guidance found in How To Merge Between Two Local Repositories to accomplish this with mixed results.
Note: Our staging site cast from the main branch of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk, an Azure static app, can be accessed via https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net.
The Workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve captured the inputs and output of the workflow below.</description></item></channel></rss>
