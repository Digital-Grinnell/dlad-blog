The collection should have a small, but diverse, set of objects covering all of the popular content, or CModel, types that we currently have in DG.

This process was triggered by ITS&amp;rsquo; intent to move DG&amp;rsquo;s FEDORA repository to a new server. That new server is currently mounted on node DGDockerX, my staging server, as /mnt/datastage and it contains a copy of DG&amp;rsquo;s production FEDORA repository made on or about June 15, 2020.

Valid Book Datastream Structure I want to begin here by showing what I see as a &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; working book datastream structure in Digital.Grinnell. The image below is a screen grab of the datastreams from the Grinnell College Yearbook 1961, DG object grinnell:23749:

It&amp;rsquo;s easy, but there are some things to consider before I show you how.
Collection Guidelines There are no &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; guidelines for the creation of a collection or sub-collection in Digital.Grinnell, but I can think of a couple &amp;ldquo;informal&amp;rdquo; things to consider.
Are there or will there ever be enough objects, old and/or new, with something in common to warrant a new collection?</description></item><item><title>Oral History Transcription Workflow</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/077-oral-history-transcription-workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/077-oral-history-transcription-workflow/</guid><description>Digital.Grinnell features a fair number of transcribed digital oral histories.

This is a Python 3 and Flask web application designed to transform oral history transcripts, presumably created using InqScribe, into XML suitable for ingest into the Islandora Oral Histories Solution Pack to populate a TRANSCRIPT datastream and its derivatives.</description></item><item><title>Digital.Grinnell Custom MODS Display</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/076-digital.grinnell-custom-mods-display/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/076-digital.grinnell-custom-mods-display/</guid><description>Digital.Grinnell has seen a lot of customization over the years, and quite a bit of it relates to how an object&amp;rsquo;s metadata, especially its MODS metadata, is displayed. My aim for the past couple of years has been to remove as much customization as possible, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it difficult to remove features of our MODS display because those features seem to be rather popular. This is particulary true of our compound object display.

Experience leads me to beleive that keeping a complex Drupal view in code is prudent, but overriding that code with a database copy of the view helps tremendously in terms of system performance. So, I recommend keeping the view code in the module, but that means that when significant changes are made, like the addition of a new colleciton, the code should be updated in the database to speed things up.</description></item><item><title>Staging Digital.Grinnell (DG) on DigitalOcean (DO)</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/062-testing-dg-staging-on-digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/062-testing-dg-staging-on-digitalocean/</guid><description>ISLE v1.3.0 has been running on my staging server, DGDockerX, for months now and it seems to be performing as-expected with one exception&amp;hellip; when I try to import a batch of objects using IMI, the Islandora Multi-Importer, I get the following error:

This post is an addition to the discussion in post 028, Mounting //Storage for IMI Ingest in Digital.Grinnell which was written largely to remind me how the //Storage mount works. 😕 Unlike post 028, this post is meant for myself AND for others at Grinnell College who prepare digital objects for ingest via IMI.</description></item><item><title>PDF Ingest in Digital.Grinnell</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/029-pdf-ingest-in-digital-grinnell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 16:56:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/029-pdf-ingest-in-digital-grinnell/</guid><description>A set of 21 PDF objects were ingested into Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s Faculty Scholarship collection using IMI on 22-July-2019; unfortunately none of these PDFs contained OCR (optical character recognition) or &amp;ldquo;text recognition&amp;rdquo; data, so none of them generated a valid FULL_TEXT datastream. FULL_TEXT datastreams are required to make PDF, and similar text content, searchable and discoverable in Digital.Grinnell.
In order to confirm that the lack of OCR was in fact the problem, I ran a little test on https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell:26702, one of the 21 objects.</description></item><item><title>Mounting //STORAGE for IMI Ingest in Digital.Grinnell</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/028-mounting-storage-for-imi-ingest-in-digital-grinnell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/028-mounting-storage-for-imi-ingest-in-digital-grinnell/</guid><description>Claiming another small victory today! Why? Well, the Digital.Grinnell instance of IMI (Islandora Multi-Importer) module is customized so that choosing &amp;ldquo;*local&amp;rdquo; as an object ingest source invokes a hook function I created in our DG7 module. That hook enables IMI to &amp;ldquo;find&amp;rdquo; named files/content (things like PDFs, images, etc.) in the Grinnell College //STORAGE server. //STORAGE can be mounted as a CIFS (Common Internet File System) and used to drive ingest if the right package/drivers are made available to Islandora. That can be a little tricky in ISLE, but it&amp;rsquo;s manageable.</description></item></channel></rss>
