So kudos to Goran Nikolovski and his blog post.
The problem I ran into involved the Drupal update.php script, and an orphaned bit of configuration data. When I tried running update.php the first of 13 pending database updates kept throwing an exception telling me of a missing plugin, and that effectively killed the other 12 updates. ðŸ˜¦ Well, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t care that it was missing (and Drupal should not either) because the update was there to delete it, but since the update kept failing, we had ourselves an impossible loop.</description></item></channel></rss>
