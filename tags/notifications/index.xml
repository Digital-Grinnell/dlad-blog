In the case of emails automatically dispatched by &lt;em>GitHub&lt;/em> the &amp;ldquo;butchering&amp;rdquo; of such messages leaves me with an almost useles notification, one that&amp;rsquo;s so badly bloated that I typically choose to ignore it. Clearly, that&amp;rsquo;s not how notifications are suppsoed to be handled.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To help make my point I&amp;rsquo;ll share a small portion of a relatively small email notification below. Yes, I used the term &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; more than once in that last sentence. Why? Because this is a tiny example compared to some that I&amp;rsquo;ve received lately.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
