In the case of emails automatically dispatched by GitHub the &amp;ldquo;butchering&amp;rdquo; of such messages leaves me with an almost useles notification, one that&amp;rsquo;s so badly bloated that I typically choose to ignore it. Clearly, that&amp;rsquo;s not how notifications are suppsoed to be handled.
