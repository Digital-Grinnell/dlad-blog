ICG Git Workflow: How to work with Git The examples in this document use my work with the Islandora Collaboration Group&amp;rsquo;s (ICG) ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools repository, as well as my fork and local clone of that repository. I recommend having a look at the GitHub Glossary for a list of terms used frequently in this post, and many of the referenced documents.</description></item></channel></rss>
