As of this writing the iPad has not been re-installed, but Facilities Management has been contacted to schedule that event soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Due to small differences between the aspect ratio and resolution of the old versus new devices, the kiosk site had to be re-designed. Changes were also necessary to help ensure that users of the kiosk could not &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; from the VAF screens and cause havoc by surfing the internet. As a result, a new &lt;em>private&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/vaf">https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/vafvaf-kiosk&lt;/a> repository was created and eventually deployed for kiosk use ONLY via DigitalOcean&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>App&lt;/em> platform. The new kiosk site is deployed to &lt;a href="https://vaf-kiosk-2021-xjmpc.ondigitalocean.app/">https://vaf-kiosk-2021-xjmpc.ondigitalocean.app/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
