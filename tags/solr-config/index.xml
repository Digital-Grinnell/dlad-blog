My Trello card for the issue reads:
Our newest AOH entries, and some older objects, will not display a transcript after upgrade to the latest version of the OH module. OHScribe is needed to aid in re-processing transcripts for these objects, and some XDebug work will also be required.
Engaging XDebug and PHPStorm allowed me to peek inside the relatively complex oral histories (OH) module where I found that some of our OH objects were missing key Solr field elements, like or_transcripts and or_speaker.</description></item></channel></rss>
