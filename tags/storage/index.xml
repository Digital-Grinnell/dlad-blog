The most prominent case is with regard to &lt;em>Rootstalk&lt;/em> where &lt;em>Azure&lt;/em> currently supports two (recently down from three) static development apps as well as a storage account. All such services are part of a personal* &lt;em>Azure&lt;/em> subscription opened under the &lt;a href="mailto:digital@grinnell.edu">digital@grinnell.edu&lt;/a> email address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*I call this a &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; account because charges for it are currently billed to my own credit card, a situation that will need to be changed sometime relatively soon. Fortunately, charges thus far have not exceeded $0.15 per month.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
