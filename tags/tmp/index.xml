Locally, and in staging I&amp;rsquo;ve debugged the code that is responsible for removing the temporary file once the operation is complete. Running locally or in staging the process does its job, the temporary files get deleted soon after creation, but this never happens in production. The result, our root disk on the production server fills up after a few days of use, and the server stops serving content. Even more sinister, the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash and restart &amp;ndash; a condition that would also clear the offending &lt;code>/tmp&lt;/code> files &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even report a fatal error, it just refuses to serve content, which is really its only function. Very frustrating indeed!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
