It&amp;rsquo;s just an executable package and available in &lt;a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew&lt;/a>. Jekyll, on the other hand, is based on Ruby so it requires a working Ruby environment to work in, and that can be a rail pain in the @$$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Intel MacBook, like all Macs, comes with a pre-installed and insufficent Ruby that must be kept, but also overridden with a newer version. This is an all too common problem with Macs and built-in tools.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
