CATPAW - Computer-Aided Thinking, Primarily about Writing From the CATPAW home screen&amp;hellip;
In many ways, CATPAW is an online book about writing style&amp;ndash;a guide to the choices we make in writing that connect us to our readers.
Rather than setting out rules to follow, CATPAW will help you make informed choices in context. The site accomplishes that goal in three ways:
It explains the choices writers face. It uses computational tools to help you examine your own writing, letting you see what choices you have already made and what you might want to do differently.</description></item><item><title>Managing Azure</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/130-managing-azure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/130-managing-azure/</guid><description>For the past couple years I/we have been experimenting with moving digital content to Azure, both for storage and as a web app host. The most prominent case is with regard to Rootstalk where Azure currently supports two (recently down from three) static development apps as well as a storage account. All such services are part of a personal* Azure subscription opened under the digital@grinnell.edu email address.

So, I first tried to migrate my very simple Static Landing Page Hugo static site to a new home on Azure. The process wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as slick and easy as at DigitalOcean, but Azure does nicely leverage GitHub Actions, and the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult to grasp.</description></item></channel></rss>
