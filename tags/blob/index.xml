The most prominent case is with regard to Rootstalk where Azure currently supports two (recently down from three) static development apps as well as a storage account. All such services are part of a personal* Azure subscription opened under the digital@grinnell.edu email address.
*I call this a &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; account because charges for it are currently billed to my own credit card, a situation that will need to be changed sometime relatively soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
