The Docksal portion of this discussion DID NOT WORK PROPERLY so I&amp;rsquo;ve hidden it from public view. Don&amp;rsquo;t use this project with Docksal (fin commands) until further notice!</description></item><item><title>Building Grocy in Docksal</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/036-building-grocy-in-docksal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/036-building-grocy-in-docksal/</guid><description>Grocy looks lika a great little PHP stack application for me. It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to help folks organize and inventory their &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, with a slant toward food and groceries. I need this!
Since I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Docker and Docksal, naturally I wanted to spin Grocy up in one of these environments. Thankfully, the heavy lifting of getting this &amp;ldquo;Dockerized&amp;rdquo; has already been done, and that fine work is shared in GitHub at grocy/grocy-docker. So my quest last evening started with a fork of this GitHub project to SummittDweller/grocy-docker, where I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new docksal branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
