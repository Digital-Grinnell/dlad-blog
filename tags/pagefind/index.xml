This is not really a problem with Hugo, but one with cloud deployment of Hugo static apps, particularly as an Azure Static Web App.

When I try to deploy Pagefind to the cloud, specifically as an Azure Static Web App, I can&amp;rsquo;t make it work because there&amp;rsquo;s no apparent way to invoke the necessary npx pagefind.</description></item></channel></rss>
