So, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to elaborate on this here, I&amp;rsquo;ll just provide a link to specifics documented in my personal blog:

This is not really a problem with Pagefind or Hugo, but one with cloud deployment of static apps, particularly as an Azure Static Web App or DigitalOcean static site.
The Nutshell As you may know from post 143, I have successfully installed and configured Pagefind in Rootstalk, but thus far it only works locally. When I try to deploy Pagefind to the cloud, specifically as an Azure Static Web App, I can&amp;rsquo;t make it work because there&amp;rsquo;s no apparent way to invoke the necessary npx pagefind.</description></item></channel></rss>
