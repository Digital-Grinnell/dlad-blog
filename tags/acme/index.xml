It introduces a Digital.Grinnell-specific implementation of the Traefik with Acme.sh.
Testing with McFateM/docker-traefik2-acme-host I started work on this implementation with a test, by cloning https://github.com/McFateM/docker-traefik2-acme-host and proceeding as directed in the repository&amp;rsquo;s README.md document, as user islandora on node DGDockerX, like so:

It introduces an alternative to the failed process that was proposed in that earlier post.
Note that the following config-specific elements have been replaced below:
6 occurances of ?.grinnell.edu now say example-1.grinnell.edu, and 2 occurances of ?.info now say example-2.info. New Proposal On June 1 my colleage, Matt, suggested the following&amp;hellip;
As much as I would like to resolve the DNS-01 challenge using Traefik alone, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it will support what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do here.</description></item><item><title>Simplified Testing of Traefik 2 with ACME DNS-01 Challenge</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/074-simplified-testing-traefik-2-with-acme-dns-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/074-simplified-testing-traefik-2-with-acme-dns-01/</guid><description>This post is a simplified and focused follow-up to Dockerized Traefik Host Using ACME DNS-01 Challenge.
Simplify Today, 19-May-2020, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a shot at simplifying my testing on dgdocker3.grinnell.edu by removing unnecessary things and consolidating as much as possible to reduce clutter in the logs and get right to the point. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to have a look to see if there are additional logs that can tell give me more detail. Everything used here, and everything that takes place here, will be found in a new directory, /opt/containers/test on DGDocker3.</description></item><item><title>Dockerized Traefik Host Using ACME DNS-01 Challenge</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/071-dockerized-traefik-using-acme-dns-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/071-dockerized-traefik-using-acme-dns-01/</guid><description>This post builds on My dockerized-server Config and attempts to change what was a problematic ACME HTTP-01 or httpChallenge in Traefik and Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt to an ACME DNS-01 or dnsChallenge. The problem with the old HTTP-01 or httpChallenge is that it requires the creation of a valid and widely accessible &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; record in our DNS before the creation of a cert; the record has to be in place so that the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt CA-server can find it to confirm that the request is valid.</description></item></channel></rss>
