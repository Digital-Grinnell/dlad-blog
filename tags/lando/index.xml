In order to accommodate that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved nearly all of the sites and services from that droplet to my other, &lt;em>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/em>. The site migration was a smooth process except for &lt;a href="https://wieting.tamatoledo.com">https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com&lt;/a>. That &lt;em>Drupal 8&lt;/em> site has been difficult to upgrade and migrate largely because it was deployed using my old &lt;em>Port-Ability&lt;/em> scripts, and about a year ago I scrapped &lt;em>Port-Ability&lt;/em> in favor of &lt;a href="https://docksal.io">Docksal&lt;/a>, but I never got around to moving that particular site to a &lt;em>Docksal&lt;/em> environment. Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m finding it almost impossible to complete that migration to &lt;em>Docksal&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
