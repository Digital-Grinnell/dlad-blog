&lt;div class="original">&lt;p>In many ways, CATPAW is an online book about writing style&amp;ndash;a guide to the choices we make in writing that connect us to our readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than setting out rules to follow, CATPAW will help you make informed choices in context. The site accomplishes that goal in three ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It explains the choices writers face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It uses computational tools to help you examine your own writing, letting you see what choices you have already made and what you might want to do differently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It places these choices in the context of advice from other prominent guides to writing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
