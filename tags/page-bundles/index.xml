The implementation of this shortcode required a Hugo Page Bundles content structure and the transition to such a structure is documented below in Page Bundles Structure.
attachments.html Page Bundles Structure Transitioning this blog to a page bundles organizational strucuture involved running the https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/bash-script-to-convert-hugo-content-files-to-page-bundles/9776 script which I named page-bundles.sh.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more here soon, but for now&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap.</description></item></channel></rss>
