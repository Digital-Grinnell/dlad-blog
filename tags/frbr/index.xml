&lt;p>Together, Alma and Primo (mostly Primo) apply &amp;ldquo;dedup&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;FRBR&amp;rdquo; (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) rules that unexpectedly &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo; similar titles together. Since the objects migrating from Islandora to Alma are all intended to be single and un-grouped (unless they are parts of a compound object where we expect and an intentional &amp;ldquo;grouping&amp;rdquo; of records), we need to take action to deal with these rules. Unfortunately, we cannot just turn the rules off or universally modify them since those rules also apply to ALL bib records, not just digital items.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
