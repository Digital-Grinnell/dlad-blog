As of this writing the iPad has not been re-installed, but Facilities Management has been contacted to schedule that event soon.
New DigitalOcean Deployment Due to small differences between the aspect ratio and resolution of the old versus new devices, the kiosk site had to be re-designed. Changes were also necessary to help ensure that users of the kiosk could not &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; from the VAF screens and cause havoc by surfing the internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
