Goal The goal of this project is to present a repeatable, minimal set of instructions for spinning up a safe, stand-alone, local/development instance of ISLE on any Mac running OS X.
Prerequisites This document assumes the user will be spinning up https://dg.localdomain on a Mac with a suitable DG-FEDORA USB stick mounted and accessible.</description></item><item><title>Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - One-Time Customizations</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/090-isle-local-migration-customization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/090-isle-local-migration-customization/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to earlier post 087. It is intended to chronicle my customization efforts, necessary steps that follow the aforementioned document&amp;rsquo;s Step 11, to migrate to a local development instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued iMac, MA8660, currently identified as MAD25W812UJ1G9. Please refer to Steps 0 - 11 in post 087 for background info.
Note that it should NOT be necessary to repeat steps taken in this document. Pertinent changes made herein were saved into a new completed-install-local-migrate branch of my dg-islandora project repository, effectively capturing all progress made within.</description></item><item><title>Local ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - with Annotations</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/087-rebuilding-isle-ld-again/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to earlier posts 021 and 058, with simiar titles. It is intended to chronicle my efforts to migrate to a local development instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued iMac, MA8660, currently identified as MAD25W812UJ1G9.
Goal The goal of this project is once again to spin up a local Islandora stack using the ISLE project following the guidance of the project&amp;rsquo;s install-local-migrate document. My process will be slightly different than documented since I&amp;rsquo;ve already created a pair of private dg-isle and dg-islandora repositories.</description></item><item><title>Staging Digital.Grinnell (DG) on DigitalOcean (DO)</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/062-testing-dg-staging-on-digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/062-testing-dg-staging-on-digitalocean/</guid><description>ISLE v1.3.0 has been running on my staging server, DGDockerX, for months now and it seems to be performing as-expected with one exception&amp;hellip; when I try to import a batch of objects using IMI, the Islandora Multi-Importer, I get the following error:

Directories I&amp;rsquo;ll begin by opening a terminal on the staging host, DGDockerX as user islandora. Then I very carefully (note the use of the --recursive flags!) clone the aforementioned projects to DGDockerX like so:
Host / DGDockerX Commands cd /opt git clone &amp;ndash;recursive https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle.git git clone &amp;ndash;recursive https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-islandora.git cd dg-isle git checkout staging One Useful Git Config Change One thing I learned during this process is that all of the dg-isle config files that I’ve modified and/or mapped into the containers show up as “modified” when I do a git status on the host.</description></item><item><title>Rebuilding ISLE-ld (for Local Development)</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/058-rebuilding-isle-ld/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/058-rebuilding-isle-ld/</guid><description>This post replaces my earlier post 021 with the same title. It is intended to chronicle my efforts to build a new ISLE v1.3.0 local development instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued MacBook Air, MA7053.
Goal The goal of this project is to spin up a pristine, local Islandora stack using the ISLE project at https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/dg-isle/, then introduce elements like the Digital Grinnell theme and custom modules like DG7. Once these pieces are in-place and working, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin adding other critical components as well as a robust set of data gleaned from https://digital.</description></item></channel></rss>
