Entities are best described in this &lt;a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ISLANDORA715/Entities+Solution+Pack">Entities Solution Pack&lt;/a> documentation. Quoting from that resource&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="original">&lt;p>This module allows you to add person, place, event, and organization entities to an Islandora repository. Entities are small, metadata-based objects. A number of forms and additional features are provided in this module for those building an institutional repository with Islandora. Much of the functionality for batch ingest and autocomplete (to use entities as authority objects) centres [sic] around the MADS forms provided with the module.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding LASIR Features to DG</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/099-adding-lasir-features-to-dg/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:31:37 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/099-adding-lasir-features-to-dg/</guid><description>&lt;p>This afternoon I finally got back to trying to implement some features of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR">LASIR&lt;/a>, the &lt;em>Liberal Arts Sprint for Institutional Repositories&lt;/em>. The information I found initially was not what I expected to encounter, and that left me scratching my head just a bit. Fortunately, a colleague at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group">ICG&lt;/a> came through with the needed information and I immediately added it to my list of key resources. You can find those resources in my &lt;em>OneTab&lt;/em> at:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; break. I hope to add some details, and more links, when I return.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
