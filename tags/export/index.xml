Digital.Grinnell Objects Over the last couple of years I have deposited some 477 digital objects, mostly JPEG images and PDFs, into Digital.Grinnell so they could be &amp;ldquo;served&amp;rdquo; up for Rootstalk. I did this because at the time Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s FEDORA repository was available and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, DG isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or responsive as it once was since its FEDORA is due to be retired in a year or two.</description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Updated Technical Details</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</guid><description>Attention: On 21-May-2020 an optional, but recommended, sixth step was added to this workflow in the form of a new _Drush_ command: _islandora\_mods_post\_processing_, an addition to my previous work in [islandora_mods_via_twig](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_via_twig).

The transition to distance learning, social distancing, and more remote work at Grinnell College in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic may afford GC Libraries an opportunity to do some overdue and necessary metadata cleaning in Digital.</description></item></channel></rss>
