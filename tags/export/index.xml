&lt;h2 id="digitalgrinnell-objects">Digital.Grinnell Objects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last couple of years I have deposited some 477 digital objects, mostly JPEG images and PDFs, into &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em> so they could be &amp;ldquo;served&amp;rdquo; up for &lt;a href="https://rootstalk.grinnell.edu">&lt;em>Rootstalk&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. I did this because at the time &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> FEDORA repository was available and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, &lt;em>DG&lt;/em> isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or responsive as it once was since its FEDORA is due to be retired in a year or two. Also, the objects had to be made available to the public so they are &amp;ldquo;visible&amp;rdquo; to &lt;em>Rootstalk&lt;/em>, but that also makes them discoverable by the public, even though they are essentially out-of-context in &lt;em>DG&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Updated Technical Details</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;b>Attention:&lt;/b> On 21-May-2020 an optional, but recommended, sixth step was added to this workflow in the form of a new _Drush_ command: _islandora\_mods_post\_processing_, an addition to my previous work in [islandora_mods_via_twig](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_via_twig). See my new post, [Islandora MODS Post Processing](/posts/075-islandora-mods-post-processing/) for complete details.

&lt;b>Attention:&lt;/b> In November 2021 a recommended seventh step was added to this workflow. That addition is documented in the final section of this document.

&lt;p>The transition to distance learning, social distancing, and more remote work at &lt;em>Grinnell College&lt;/em> in the wake of the &lt;em>COVID-19&lt;/em> pandemic may afford &lt;em>GC Libraries&lt;/em> an opportunity to do some overdue and necessary metadata cleaning in &lt;a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu">Digital.Grinnell&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-5-step-workflow">A 5-Step Workflow&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This turned out to be a much more difficult undertaking than I imagined, but as of mid-April, 2020, I have a 5-step workflow that actually works. This post will introduce all five steps, but only provides details for Step 3, &lt;a href="#editing-a-modstsv-file">Editing a MODS TSV File&lt;/a>, the portion that metadata editors need to be most aware of. All technical details, as well as steps 1, 2, 4 and 5, will be addressed in &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/">Exporting, Editing, &amp;amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Technical Details&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
