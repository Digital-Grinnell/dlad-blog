At this early date it&amp;rsquo;s just a link to the Atom No More? blog post in my personal blog.
The note above indicates that this post superseeds 085-remote-atom, but there are other Atom-related posts that are also impacted.
Some of these include:
posts/033-adding-lastmod-date/ As time passes I&amp;rsquo;ll document here any work-specific changes I make to my new VS Code environments.
And that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap. Until next time, stay safe and wash your hands!</description></item></channel></rss>
