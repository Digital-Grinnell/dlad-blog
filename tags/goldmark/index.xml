The official word, from this document states that:
Goldmark is from Hugo 0.60 the default library used for Markdown. It’s fast, it’s CommonMark compliant and it’s very flexible. Note that the feature set of Goldmark vs Blackfriday isn’t the same; you gain a lot but also lose some, but we will work to bridge any gap in the upcoming Hugo versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
