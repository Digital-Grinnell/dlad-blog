It&amp;rsquo;s aim is to help folks organize and inventory their &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, with a slant toward food and groceries. I need this!
Since I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Docker and Docksal, naturally I wanted to spin Grocy up in one of these environments. Thankfully, the heavy lifting of getting this &amp;ldquo;Dockerized&amp;rdquo; has already been done, and that fine work is shared in GitHub at grocy/grocy-docker. So my quest last evening started with a fork of this GitHub project to SummittDweller/grocy-docker, where I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new docksal branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
