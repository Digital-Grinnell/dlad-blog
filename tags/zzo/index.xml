Well, what was once is once again. If you read my &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/067-new-blog-style-and-features/">New Blog Style and Features&lt;/a> post you can learn a little more of this blog&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;interim&amp;rdquo; history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the way, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post at &lt;a href="https://dlad.summittdweller.com">https://dlad.summittdweller.com&lt;/a>, then you&amp;rsquo;re missing out. &lt;em>If you are looking at that old blog you probably see something more like this:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

All of the content, aka &amp;lsquo;posts&amp;rsquo;, from my old blog have been moved here, but there are still lots of remnants of the new theme, &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-zzo/en">Zzo&lt;/a>, lurking here. Please be patient with this new format while I work to fully implement all the features that this setup provides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, thank you, Mackenzie. My daughter played an important role in helping me with this transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s time to do some real work&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to share more here soon. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
