The production branch update of Rootstalk in February 2024 resulted in a Git error stating Updates rejected because tip of current branch behind remote counterpart. Since my local production branch was correct after updates were applied, I used a git push --force-with-lease command from https://stackoverflow.com/posts/70300076/timeline to get things back in-sync.
In this document I will attempt to capture the ordered steps required to publish a new &amp;ldquo;issue&amp;rdquo; of Rootstalk in it&amp;rsquo;s newest environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
