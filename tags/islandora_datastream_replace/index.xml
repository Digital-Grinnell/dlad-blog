Since these two collections are relatively &amp;ldquo;fluid&amp;rdquo;, they get frequent additions and metadata changes, I was worried that introducing bulk edits could negatively impact some objects. So I set out to find, or create, a tool that would help me evaluate the impact of these edits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="islandora-pretty-text-diff">Islandora Pretty Text Diff&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was fortunate to find a very nice tool all ready-to-go, the &lt;em>Islandora Pretty Text Diff&lt;/em> module, specifically &lt;a href="https://github.com/contentmath/islandora_pretty_text_diff">islandora_pretty_text_diff&lt;/a>. I installed and enabled this module on &lt;em>DGDocker1&lt;/em> in early February 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Updated Technical Details</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/115-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-updated-technical-details/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;b>Attention:&lt;/b> On 21-May-2020 an optional, but recommended, sixth step was added to this workflow in the form of a new _Drush_ command: _islandora\_mods_post\_processing_, an addition to my previous work in [islandora_mods_via_twig](https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/islandora_mods_via_twig). See my new post, [Islandora MODS Post Processing](/posts/075-islandora-mods-post-processing/) for complete details.

&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="annotation">
&lt;b>Attention:&lt;/b> In November 2021 a recommended seventh step was added to this workflow. That addition is documented in the final section of this document.

But this post has nothing to do with those things so I need to clear my head and press on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A WARC is essentially a file format used to capture the content and organization of a web site. Recently, I was asked to add a pair of WARCs to &lt;em>Digital.Grinnell&lt;/em>. Doing so proved to be quite an adventure, but I am pleased to report that we now have these two objects to show for it:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing, &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Technical Details</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>The transition to distance learning, social distancing, and more remote work at &lt;em>Grinnell College&lt;/em> in the wake of the &lt;em>COVID-19&lt;/em> pandemic may afford &lt;em>GC Libraries&lt;/em> an opportunity to do some overdue and necessary metadata cleaning in &lt;a href="https://digital.grinnell.edu">Digital.Grinnell&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This turned out to be a much more difficult undertaking than I imagined, but as of mid-April, 2020, I have a 5-step workflow that actually works. This post will introduce all five steps, but only provides details for Step 3, &lt;a href="#editing-a-modstsv-file">Editing a MODS TSV File&lt;/a>, the portion that metadata editors need to be most aware of. All technical details, as well as steps 1, 2, 4 and 5, will be addressed in &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/">Exporting, Editing, &amp;amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Technical Details&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
