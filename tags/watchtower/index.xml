The problem with the old HTTP-01 or httpChallenge is that it requires the creation of a valid and widely accessible &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; record in our DNS before the creation of a cert; the record has to be in place so that the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt CA-server can find it to confirm that the request is valid.</description></item></channel></rss>
