Since these two collections are relatively &amp;ldquo;fluid&amp;rdquo;, they get frequent additions and metadata changes, I was worried that introducing bulk edits could negatively impact some objects. So I set out to find, or create, a tool that would help me evaluate the impact of these edits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="islandora-pretty-text-diff">Islandora Pretty Text Diff&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was fortunate to find a very nice tool all ready-to-go, the &lt;em>Islandora Pretty Text Diff&lt;/em> module, specifically &lt;a href="https://github.com/contentmath/islandora_pretty_text_diff">islandora_pretty_text_diff&lt;/a>. I installed and enabled this module on &lt;em>DGDocker1&lt;/em> in early February 2022.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
