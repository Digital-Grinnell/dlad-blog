Thus far I&amp;rsquo;ve found a couple of promising resources to guide the effort:
Custom 404 Page Custom 404 pages in Hugo done right In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on &amp;ldquo;Option 2&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;done right&amp;rdquo; document, and the &amp;ldquo;Azure Static Web App&amp;rdquo; portion of the first document.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will soon be much more here, but for this installment&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap!</description></item><item><title>Automated Proofreading with `htmlproofer`</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/133-automated-proofreading-with-htmlproofer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/133-automated-proofreading-with-htmlproofer/</guid><description>What follows is a January 2022 excerpt from a piece of Rootstalk project documentation titled Automated-Testing.md&amp;hellip;
Automated Testing Today I started a little side-project aimed at helping test or &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; the Rootstalk structure and content. I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to use the package/process documented in this GitHub repo.
I started on the command-line of my MacBook Pro like so:

This should be a simple repeat of the process documented in Sync Rootstalk Production (DigitalOcean) with Dev. As before, I used guidance found in How To Merge Between Two Local Repositories to accomplish this.</description></item><item><title>VSCode Find and Replace Using `regex`</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/128-vscode-find-and-replace-using-regex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/128-vscode-find-and-replace-using-regex/</guid><description>This morning I needed to do some bulk &amp;ldquo;find and replace&amp;rdquo; operations in most of my Rootstalk content. My first thought was to write and run a little Python script, but then I wondered what VSCode might bring to the table. Plenty, it brought plenty!
To keep this post as brief as possible, I&amp;rsquo;m simply going to reference an instructional video that I created earlier: VSCode-Find-and-Replace.mp4.
A list of some links mentioned in the video is provided here:

Digital.Grinnell Objects Over the last couple of years I have deposited some 477 digital objects, mostly JPEG images and PDFs, into Digital.Grinnell so they could be &amp;ldquo;served&amp;rdquo; up for Rootstalk. I did this because at the time Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s FEDORA repository was available and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, DG isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or responsive as it once was since its FEDORA is due to be retired in a year or two.</description></item><item><title>Sync Rootstalk Production (DigitalOcean) with Dev</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/116-sync-rootstalk-production-do-with-dev/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/116-sync-rootstalk-production-do-with-dev/</guid><description>My goal for this morning, December 22, 2021, was to find a process I could reliably use to synchronize changes in the development copy of Rootstalk (the main branch https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk) with our production deployment (the main branch of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-DO) to DigitalOcean.

Note: Our staging site cast from the main branch of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk, an Azure static app, can be accessed via https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net.

Wherever possible I&amp;rsquo;ll strike-through outdated information like this, and replace it with updated info.
This post will instruct the reader to install necessary tools and engage the workflow I now use to develop and maintain a handful of Hugo static websites. The list of sites now includes both professional, those owned and operated by Grinnell College, as well as &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; sites that I develop, maintain and host myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
