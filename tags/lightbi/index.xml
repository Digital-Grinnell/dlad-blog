Project Repository - https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-with-lightbi. This new repo effectively replaces https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk which is being archived. Development Deployment - https://victorious-ground-0e1427110.3.azurestaticapps.net/ is the new deployment from the main branch of https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/rootstalk-with-lightbi. Also&amp;hellip; To reduce costs I&amp;rsquo;ve already eliminated the old deployment of the old main branch to https://icy-tree-020380010.</description></item></channel></rss>
