No matter, rather than working to get that restored I thought I&amp;rsquo;d dry using a &lt;code>Virtual Desktop&lt;/code> connection to a Windows VM. I also had some need to work with Windows in other capacities so this seemed like a nice dual-purpose solution. It worked! Now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember and document how it works.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
