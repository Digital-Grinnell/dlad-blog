That old search mechanism used &lt;a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse&lt;/a>, which has NO dependencies, but that old scheme used a &lt;em>Hugo&lt;/em> theme component that I found difficult to properly maintain. So, as this blog was moving to &lt;em>Azure&lt;/em> I elected to try something a little different with &lt;em>Fuse&lt;/em> and found &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/gtrevg/a34e0c736d358771437be05c6401e86c">this gist&lt;/a> to help get it done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of this writing, the new search is limited to just finding &lt;code>tag&lt;/code> references, and sometimes a search will return a 404 error because of a bad path reference. If you try to search and get the 404 error have a look at the returned URL and if it reads like &lt;code>.../search/search?search-query...&lt;/code> then you&amp;rsquo;ve got one too many instances of the term &lt;code>search&lt;/code>. Remove that first &lt;code>/search&lt;/code> term, including the slash in front of it, and hit return. The search should now return valid results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back in (Scarlet and) Black</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/083-back-in-scarlet-and-black/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/083-back-in-scarlet-and-black/</guid><description>&lt;p>Once upon a time this blog had an address of &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM">https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM&lt;/a> and it used a theme called &lt;a href="https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c">M10c&lt;/a>. Well, what was once is once again. If you read my &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/067-new-blog-style-and-features/">New Blog Style and Features&lt;/a> post you can learn a little more of this blog&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;interim&amp;rdquo; history.&lt;/p>
