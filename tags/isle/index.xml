So, I&amp;rsquo;m adopting a new, lean and mean process for updating it from this point forward. Basically the process will involve backing up the code that&amp;rsquo;s already in place, then using drush up to upgrade the Drupal modules and core if necessary.
That process on January 19, 2023, went something like this&amp;hellip;

Specifically, I found the following resource to be most helpful:
https://intellipaat.com/community/9971/git-update-submodule-to-latest-commit-on-origin In case that post ever disappers, here&amp;rsquo;s the gist of it&amp;hellip;
The git submodule update command actually tells git that you simply want your submodules to each check out the commit already mentioned in the index of the superproject.
If you want to update your submodules to the most recent commit available from their remote, you&amp;rsquo;ll try this directly within the submodules.</description></item><item><title>Production ISLE Installation: Migrate Existing Islandora Site - with Annotations</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/096-production-isle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/096-production-isle/</guid><description>This post is an addendum to earlier post 092.

The goal of this project is to spin up a pristine, local Islandora stack using an updated fork of the ISLE project at https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/dg-isle, then introduce elements like the Digital Grinnell theme and custom modules like DG7. Once these pieces are in-place and working, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin adding other critical components as well as a robust set of data gleaned from https://digital.</description></item><item><title>Building ISLE 1.3.0 (ld) for Local Development</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/034-building-isle-1.3.0-ld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/034-building-isle-1.3.0-ld/</guid><description>This post, an updated (the original was written in August 2019 for ISLE-1.2.0) follow-up to a previous post is intended to chronicle my efforts to build a new ~ISLE v1.2.0~ ISLE-1.3.0, ld, or local development, instance of Digital.Grinnell on my work-issued MacBook, ma7053.

Why? Well, the Digital.Grinnell instance of IMI (Islandora Multi-Importer) module is customized so that choosing &amp;ldquo;*local&amp;rdquo; as an object ingest source invokes a hook function I created in our DG7 module. That hook enables IMI to &amp;ldquo;find&amp;rdquo; named files/content (things like PDFs, images, etc.) in the Grinnell College //STORAGE server. //STORAGE can be mounted as a CIFS (Common Internet File System) and used to drive ingest if the right package/drivers are made available to Islandora. That can be a little tricky in ISLE, but it&amp;rsquo;s manageable.</description></item><item><title>Missing Oral History Transcripts in DG - Fixed</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/026-oral-history-solr-fix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 13:09:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/026-oral-history-solr-fix/</guid><description>I recently constructed a new, local/development instance of ISLE (see my previous post) largely in order to debug a mystery in Digital.Grinnell&amp;rsquo;s display of oral histories. My Trello card for the issue reads:
Our newest AOH entries, and some older objects, will not display a transcript after upgrade to the latest version of the OH module. OHScribe is needed to aid in re-processing transcripts for these objects, and some XDebug work will also be required.
Engaging XDebug and PHPStorm allowed me to peek inside the relatively complex oral histories (OH) module where I found that some of our OH objects were missing key Solr field elements, like or_transcripts and or_speaker.</description></item><item><title>Debugging PHP in ISLE: a Kludge</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/025-kludge-debugging-isle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/025-kludge-debugging-isle/</guid><description>In an earlier post I chronicle the exhaustive steps taken to create a &amp;ldquo;debuggable&amp;rdquo; local/development instance of Digital.Grinnell that behaves exactly like the real thing, except with a much smaller, portable FEDORA repository under it. I&amp;rsquo;m claiming success on that front, but there is one glaring kludge in the process that I have yet to work out.
The Kludge So, my debugging of an ISLE stack involves the coordinated configuration and engagement of XDebug inside the Apache container, and PHPStorm, along with persistence of the stack&amp;rsquo;s PHP codebase&amp;hellip; and therein lies the rub.</description></item><item><title>Debugging ISLE-ld (Local Development) in PHPStorm</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/023-debugging-isle-ld-in-phpstorm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/023-debugging-isle-ld-in-phpstorm/</guid><description>Debugging ISLE on a Mac This guidance applies to debugging PHP code in a local ISLE-ld, that&amp;rsquo;s http://isle.localdomain, instance using PHPStorm.
Modify ISLE&amp;rsquo;s docker-compose.override.yml Before engaging PHPStorm we need to make one change to our ISLE-ld configuration by running a docker cp command, making a change to our docker-compose.override.yml file, and restarting the stack. Here are the commands and procedure.
Workstation Commands cd ~/Projects/ISLE mkdir -p persistent/html docker cp isle-apache-ld:/var/www/html/. ./persistent/html The above commands will make a new ./persistent/html directory on the host, if one does not already exist, and the docker cp command will copy the current contents of the Apache container&amp;rsquo;s /var/www/html directory to the host.</description></item></channel></rss>
