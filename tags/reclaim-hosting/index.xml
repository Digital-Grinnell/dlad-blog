The website content of interest included material describing plans for the recently-completed HSSC and Administration Building projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the restoration and WARC process a &lt;code>.md&lt;/code> document named &lt;code>WARC-from-comm.sites.grinnell.edu-clone.md&lt;/code> was created and it&amp;rsquo;s contents are presented here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In July 2022 a new &amp;ldquo;clone&amp;rdquo; of the original &lt;code>comm.sites.grinnell.edu&lt;/code> web site project &amp;ndash; a &lt;em>Wordpress&lt;/em> copy that contains posts and supporting information regarding campus construction projects including the HSSC and Adminissions Center &amp;ndash; was created. That clone can be found, and administered, from &lt;a href="https://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/clone/wp-admin/index.php">https://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/clone/wp-admin/index.php&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
