&lt;p>As of this morning my &lt;code>Synergy&lt;/code> solution stopped working and I could not easily get it back in-sync between machines. This has happened before, more than once, and it&amp;rsquo;s largely the reason I abandoned &lt;code>Synergy&lt;/code> in favor of &lt;code>Sharemouse&lt;/code>. But &lt;code>Sharemouse&lt;/code> was plagued with similar issues, and it absolutely didn&amp;rsquo;t work well with VPN active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other factor today&amp;hellip; now that my GC iMac has a new &amp;ldquo;assigned identity&amp;rdquo;, I think the old system tag has to be removed from my config because &lt;code>Synergy&lt;/code> keeps expecting to find that hostname.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
