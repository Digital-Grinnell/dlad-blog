&lt;div class="original">&lt;p>The documentation is sparse (surprise, surprise), but you should be able to figure it out by example. &lt;a href="https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/js">https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/js&lt;/a> is such documentation as there is. If you take a look at our existing &lt;code>custom.js&lt;/code>, &lt;em>now part of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/primo-explore-package-CUSTOM">https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/primo-explore-package-CUSTOM&lt;/a>&lt;/em> and see how I&amp;rsquo;ve inserted the blurb about contacting me or Tony if you have problems with a link? You want to do that; you just need to find the right prm- directive to attach it to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dealing with Alma Dedup and FRBR</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/149-dealing-with-alma-dedup-and-frbr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:48:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/149-dealing-with-alma-dedup-and-frbr/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="dealing-with-almaprimo-dedup-and-frbr">Dealing with Alma/Primo Dedup and FRBR&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Together, Alma and Primo (mostly Primo) apply &amp;ldquo;dedup&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;FRBR&amp;rdquo; (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) rules that unexpectedly &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo; similar titles together. Since the objects migrating from Islandora to Alma are all intended to be single and un-grouped (unless they are parts of a compound object where we expect and an intentional &amp;ldquo;grouping&amp;rdquo; of records), we need to take action to deal with these rules. Unfortunately, we cannot just turn the rules off or universally modify them since those rules also apply to ALL bib records, not just digital items.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
