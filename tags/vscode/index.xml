The implementation of this shortcode required a Hugo Page Bundles content structure and the transition to such a structure is documented below in Page Bundles Structure.
attachments.html This shortcode, attachments.html, was lifted from Hugo Attachment shortcode, a blog post by Nelis Oostens. Successfull implementation of this shortcode one minor modification (my theme did not have a referenced partial) and conversion of my content/posts from individual Markdown (.</description></item><item><title>Migrating CATPAW Development to Azure</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/135-migrating-catpaw-development-to-azure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/135-migrating-catpaw-development-to-azure/</guid><description>Portions of this post build on concepts introduced in Managing Azure.
CATPAW - Computer-Aided Thinking, Primarily about Writing From the CATPAW home screen&amp;hellip;
In many ways, CATPAW is an online book about writing style&amp;ndash;a guide to the choices we make in writing that connect us to our readers.
Rather than setting out rules to follow, CATPAW will help you make informed choices in context. The site accomplishes that goal in three ways:
It explains the choices writers face. It uses computational tools to help you examine your own writing, letting you see what choices you have already made and what you might want to do differently.</description></item><item><title>VSCode Find and Replace Using `regex`</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/128-vscode-find-and-replace-using-regex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/128-vscode-find-and-replace-using-regex/</guid><description>This morning I needed to do some bulk &amp;ldquo;find and replace&amp;rdquo; operations in most of my Rootstalk content. My first thought was to write and run a little Python script, but then I wondered what VSCode might bring to the table. Plenty, it brought plenty!
To keep this post as brief as possible, I&amp;rsquo;m simply going to reference an instructional video that I created earlier: VSCode-Find-and-Replace.mp4.
A list of some links mentioned in the video is provided here:

At this early date it&amp;rsquo;s just a link to the Atom No More? blog post in my personal blog.
The note above indicates that this post superseeds 085-remote-atom, but there are other Atom-related posts that are also impacted.
Some of these include:
posts/033-adding-lastmod-date/ As time passes I&amp;rsquo;ll document here any work-specific changes I make to my new VSCode environments.
