See my new post, [Islandora MODS Post Processing](/posts/075-islandora-mods-post-processing/) for complete details. Attention: In November 2021 a recommended seventh step was added to this workflow. That addition is documented in the final section of this document.

Self-Transforms The first transform type can be thought of as a &amp;ldquo;self-transform&amp;rdquo; because it accepts a MODS input and produces a modified MODS output; there is no change in schema, just changes in the data and its order.
MODS-to-DC Transforms All other transforms relevant to this document are &amp;ldquo;MODS-to-DC&amp;rdquo; transforms. They accept a valid MODS record and output a corresponding, valid record under the DC schema.</description></item><item><title>Digital.Grinnell Custom MODS Display</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/076-digital.grinnell-custom-mods-display/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/076-digital.grinnell-custom-mods-display/</guid><description>Digital.Grinnell has seen a lot of customization over the years, and quite a bit of it relates to how an object&amp;rsquo;s metadata, especially its MODS metadata, is displayed. My aim for the past couple of years has been to remove as much customization as possible, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it difficult to remove features of our MODS display because those features seem to be rather popular. This is particulary true of our compound object display.
Custom Compound/Child MODS Display At present, May 28, 2020, the MODS display for a typical compound/child object in Digital.</description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing, &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams: Technical Details</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/070-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams-technical-details/</guid><description>Attention: On 21-May-2020 an optional, but recommended, sixth step was added to this workflow in the form of a new Drush command: islandora_mods_post_processing, an addition to my previous work in islandora_mods_via_twig.

A 5-Step Workflow This document is follow-up, with technical details, to Exporting, Editing, &amp;amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams, post 069, in my blog. In case you missed it, the aforementioned post was written specifically for metadata editors working on the 2020 Grinnell College Libraries review of Digital Grinnell MODS metadata.</description></item><item><title>Exporting, Editing, &amp; Replacing MODS Datastreams</title><link>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/069-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://static.grinnell.edu/dlad-blog/posts/069-exporting-editing-replacing-mods-datastreams/</guid><description>Attention: On 21-May-2020 an optional, but recommended, sixth step was added to this workflow in the form of a new Drush command: islandora_mods_post_processing, an addition to my previous work in islandora_mods_via_twig.

The transition to distance learning, social distancing, and more remote work at Grinnell College in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic may afford GC Libraries an opportunity to do some overdue and necessary metadata cleaning in Digital.</description></item></channel></rss>
